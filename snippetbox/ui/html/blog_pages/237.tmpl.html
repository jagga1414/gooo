<p><span style="text-decoration:underline"><strong><span style="text-decoration:underline">Instruments not duly stamped, inadmissible</span></strong></span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration:underline">Sec. 35, <span class="uppercase">Indian Stamp Act</span> </span> reads as under:</p>
<ul class="has-small-font-size wp-block-list">
<li>“35. <span style="text-decoration:underline">Instruments not duly stamped inadmissible in evidence, etc</span>.–No instrument chargeable with duty shall be admitted in evidence <span style="text-decoration:underline">for any purpose</span> by any person having by law or consent of parties authority to receive evidence, or shall be acted upon, registered or authenticated by any such person or by any public officer, unless such instrument is duly stamped: </li>
<li>Provided that—(a) any such instrument<sup>  </sup>shall, be admitted in evidence on payment of the duty with which the same is chargeable, or, in the case of an instrument insufficiently stamped, of the amount required to make up such duty, together with a penalty of five rupees, or, when ten times the amount of the proper duty or deficient portion thereof exceeds five rupees, of a sum equal to ten times such duty or portion;</li>
<li>(b) where any person from whom a stamped receipt could have been demanded, has given an unstamped receipt and such receipt, if stamped, would be admissible in evidence against him, then such receipt shall be admitted in evidence against him, then such receipt shall be admitted in evidence against him on payment of a penalty of one rupee by the person tendering it;</li>
<li>(c) where a contract or agreement of any kind is effected by correspondence consisting of two or more letters and any one of the letters bears the proper stamp, the contract or agreement shall be deemed to be duly stamped;</li>
<li>(d)  nothing herein contained shall prevent the admission of any instrument in evidence in any proceeding in a Criminal Court, other than a proceeding under Chapter XII or Chapter XXXVI of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898 (5 of 1898);</li>
<li>(e) nothing herein contained shall prevent the admission of any instrument in any Court when such instrument has been executed by or on behalf of<sup> </sup> the<sup> </sup>Government or where it bears the certificate of the Collector as provided by section 32 or any other provision of this Act. </li>
</ul>
<p><span style="text-decoration:underline"><strong>Unstamped document cannot be looked at even for any collateral purpose</strong></span></p>
<p>Privy Council in Ram Rattan v. Parma Nath,<strong> </strong>AIR 1946 PC 51, held that section 35 of the Stamp Act prohibited the <span style="text-decoration:underline">unstamped (or inadequately stamped) document from being looked at</span> even for any collateral purpose, as it enacts that no instrument chargeable with duty shall be admitted in evidence ‘for any purpose’. The unstamped (or inadequately stamped) document becomes admissible on payment of penalty under Stamp Act or on payment of the stamp duty after impounding.</p>
<p>In <strong>Omprakash v. Laxminarayan</strong>, (2014) 1 SCC 618, the Apex Court observed as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li class="has-small-font-size">“From a plain reading of the aforesaid provision (<span style="text-decoration:underline">S. 35 of the Stamp Act</span>), it is evident that an authority to receive evidence <span style="text-decoration:underline">shall not admit any instrument unless it is duly stamped</span>. An instrument not duly stamped shall be admitted in evidence on payment of the duty with which the same is chargeable or in the case of an instrument insufficiently stamped, of the amount required to make up such duty together with penalty. As we have observed earlier, the deed of agreement having been <span style="text-decoration: underline">insufficiently stamped, the same was inadmissible in evidence.</span> The court being an authority to receive a document in evidence to give effect thereto, the agreement to sell with possession is an instrument which requires payment of the stamp duty applicable to a deed of conveyance. Duty as required, has not been paid and, hence, the trial court rightly held the same to be inadmissible in evidence.” </li>
</ul>
<p>The Apex Court upheld the observation of the MP High Court in Writ Petition No. 6464 of 2008, overruling the impugned judgment (Laxminarayan v. Omprakash 2008 (2) MPLJ 416). The MP High Court had observed as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li class="has-small-font-size">“8. A document would be admissible on basis of the recitals made in the document and not on basis of the pleadings raised by the parties. …. </li>
<li class="has-small-font-size">9. It would be trite to say that if in a document certain recitals are made then the Court would decide the admissibility of the document on the strength of such recitals and not otherwise. In a given case, if there is an absolute unregistered sale deed and the parties say that the same is not required to be registered then <span style="text-decoration:underline">we don’t think that the Court would be entitled to admit the document because simply the parties say so.</span> The jurisdiction of the Court flows from Sec. 33, 35 and 38 of the Indian Stamp Act and the Court has to decide the question of admissibility. With all humility at our command we overrule the judgment in the matter of Laxminarayan (supra).”  </li>
</ul>
<p><strong><u>N.N. Global held – If Arb. Agreement Unstamped, No ‘Valid Arb. Agreement Exists’</u></strong></p>
<p>Before the 5-Judge-Bench of the Supreme Court, it was argued –</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>by the respondents/defendants, on the basis of the relevant provisions of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 (especially Sec. 16), that an arbitration clause would stand as a distinct, separate and independent from the substantive contract and that an arbitration reference can be made by the court even if the arbitration agreement was insufficiently stamped; and</li>
<li>by the appellant/plaintiff, in view of the provisions in the Indian Stamp Act (especially Sec. 33 and 35), that the arbitration reference could not be made by the court on the basis of an insufficiently stamped agreement. It was pointed out that unstamped or insufficiently stamped documents cannot be used as evidence for any purpose, as provided in the Stamp Act; and that for reference under Sec. 8 of the Arbitration Act the court has to specifically <strong>find that <em>prima facie</em> a “valid arbitration agreement exists</strong>“.</li>
</ul>
<p>It is held, by majority (3:2), in <strong>N.N. Global Mercantile (P) Ltd. v. Indo Unique Flame Ltd., 2023 SCC OnLine SC 495</strong>, that an arbitration reference cannot be made by the court under Sec. 8 of the Arb. Act, on the basis of an unstamped or insufficiently stamped agreement.</p>
<p>The Majority affirmed the findings in this regard, in the two earlier 3-Judge Bench decisions.</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>(i) Garware Wall Ropes Ltd. v. Coastal Marine Constructions &amp; Engg. Ltd., (2019) 9 SCC 209 (it was held that an arbitration reference cannot be made on the basis of an unstamped or insufficiently stamped agreement).</li>
<li>(ii) Vidya Drolia v. Durga Trading Corporation, 2021-2 SCC 1 (it was held that landlord-tenant disputes covered and governed by rent control legislation would not be arbitrable when specific court or forum has been given exclusive jurisdiction to apply and decide special rights and obligations).</li>

<p><strong><u>Admission of Contents of Document in Pleadings</u></strong></p>
<p>In Perumal Chettiar v. Kamakshi Ammal, AIR 1938 Mad 785; (1938) 2 MLJ 189, it is observed, as to pleadings, as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“The result, in India, is that if by reason of the document being <span style="text-decoration: underline">unstamped,</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline">no evidence of its contents </span>whether primary or secondary is admissible, evidence of admissions by the defendant is equally inadmissible. The <span style="text-decoration: underline">position may be different where admissions are made in the pleadings </span>themselves (cf.

</ul>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">Objection is to be raised when Document Tendered</span></strong></p>
<p>Our Apex Court held in <strong>Sirikonda Madhava Rao v. N. Hemalatha</strong>, <strong>12 April, 2022</strong> (referring Javer Chand v. Pukhraj Surana, (1962-2 SCR 333 and Shyamal Kumar Roy v. Sushil Kumar Agarwal, 2006-11 SCC 331) that  after marking a document unopposed, it is not open to the parties, or even the court, to reexamine the order or issue. In this case. a  document purporting to be an unregistered and insufficiently-stamped sale deed was marked as an Exhibit. The High Court directed that the aforesaid document should be de-marked and not be treated as an exhibit.It is said by the Supreme Court –</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“<span style="text-decoration: underline">Once a document has been admitted in evidence, such admission cannot be called in question at any stage of the suit</span> or proceedings on the ground that the instrument has not been duly stamped. Objection as to admissibility of a document on the ground of sufficiency of stamp, has to raised when the document is tendered in evidence. Thereafter, it is not open to the parties, or even the court, to reexamine the order or issue.”</li>
</ul>
<p>In Lothamasu Sambasiva Rao v. Thadwarthi Balakotiah, AIR 1973 AP 342, and several other decisions it was held that Section 35 was only a bar to the admissibility of an unstamped or insufficiently stamped document; and that when it had been admitted in evidence it could not have been, afterwards, withdrawn.

</ul>
<p>However, it was observed by the Supreme Court in 2001 in <strong>Bipin Shantilal Panchal v. State of Gujarat</strong>, AIR 2001 SC 1158, that that ‘it is an archaic practice that during the evidence collecting stage, whenever any objection is raised regarding admissibility of any material in evidence the court does not proceed further without passing order on such objection’. And the Court directed as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li class="has-small-font-size">“When so recast, the practice which can be a better substitute is this: Whenever an objection is raised during evidence taking stage regarding the admissibility of any material or item of oral evidence the trial court can make a note of such objection and mark the objected document tentatively as an exhibit in the case (or record the objected part of the oral evidence) subject to such objections to be decided at the last stage in the final judgment.”</li>
</ul>
<p>But, the subsequent decisions in <strong>R.V.E. Venkatachala Gounder</strong>: AIR 2004 SC 4082; <strong>Dayamathi Bai</strong> (2004) 7  SCC 107 took a contra view. It was held that the objection as to ‘mode of proof’ <span style="text-decoration:underline">should be taken at the time of marking of the document as an exhibit</span>, so that the defect can be cured by the affected party.</p>

<li>       “6. From the aforesaid statutory provisions and the decisions, it is clear that a duty is cast upon every judge to examine every document, which is produced or comes before him in the performance of his functions. On such examination, if it appears to the Judge that such instrument is not duly stamped, an obligation is cast upon him to impound the same. This duty is to be performed by the Judge irrespective of the fact whether any objection to its marking is raised or not. Hence, there is a need for diligence on the part of the Court having regard to the statutory obligation under Section 33 of the Karnataka Stamp Act. <span style="text-decoration:underline">Section 34 of the Karnataka Stamp Act<strong>*</strong> mandates</span> that an instrument, which is <span style="text-decoration:underline">not duly stamped shall not be admitted in evidence</span>.

If this document is found to be insufficiently stamped, then in terms of the proviso(a) to Section 34, the Court shall call upon the person, who is tendering the said document to pay duty and ten times penalty and thereafter admit the document in evidence. If duty and penalty is not paid, the document shall not be admitted in evidence.<strong><span style="text-decoration:underline"> </span></strong>

<p>Referring Sec. 36 of the (Indian) Stamp Act, Karnataka High Court pointed out in Nanda Behera v. Akhsaya Kumar Behera, 2017AIR (CC) 1893, relying on Javer Chand v. Pukhraj Surana, AIR 1961 SC 1655, and Yellapu Uma Maheswari v. Buddha Jagadheeswara Rao, (2015) 16 SCC 787, as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li class="has-small-font-size">“12. Thus where a question as to the admissibility of a document is raised on the ground that it has not been stamped or has not been properly stamped, it has to be decided then and there when the document is tendered in evidence. Once the Court, rightly or wrongly, decides to admit the document in evidence, <span style="text-decoration: underline">so far as the parties are concerned, the matter is closed</span>. Parties to a litigation, where such a controversy is raised, have to be circumspect and the party challenging the admissibility of the document has to be alert to see that the document is not admitted in evidence by the Court. The Court has to judicially determine the matter as soon as the document is tendered in evidence and before it is marked as an exhibit. Once a document has been admitted in evidence, it is not open either to the trial court itself or to a Court of Appeal or revision to go behind that order. Such an order is not one of those judicial orders which are liable to be reviewed or revised by the same Court or a Court of superior jurisdiction. An <span style="text-decoration: underline">unregistered document can be relied upon for <strong>collateral purpose</strong></span> i.e. <span style="text-decoration: underline">severancy of title</span>, <span style="text-decoration: underline">nature of possession</span> of various shares but <span style="text-decoration: underline">not for the primary purpose i.e. division</span> of joint properties <span style="text-decoration: underline">by metes and bounds</span>. An <span style="text-decoration: underline">unstamped instrument is not admissible in evidence even for <strong>collateral purpose</strong></span>, until the same is impounded. If the petitioner wants to mark the documents for collateral purpose, it is open to him to pay the stamp duty together with penalty and get the document impounded.

<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">What is Collateral Purpose?</span></strong></p>
<p>The word ‘collateral’ signifies something beyond or parallel. According to Law Lexicon it means “that which is by the side, and not the direct line; that which is additional to or beyond a thing” (Amit Khanna.  Vs Suchi Khanna, 2008-10 ADJ 426; 2009-75 AllLR 34; 2009-1 AWC 929).</p>
<p>The Apex Court in K.B. Saha and Sons Private Limited v. Development Consultant Ltd., (2008) 8 SCC 564: 2008 AIR SCW 4829, held as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li class="has-small-font-size">“A <strong>collateral transaction</strong> must be independent of, or divisible from, the transaction to effect which the law required registration.”</li>
<li class="has-small-font-size">“A <strong>collateral transaction</strong> must be a transaction not itself required to be effected by a registered document, that is, a transaction creating, etc. any right, title or interest in immovable property of the value of one hundred rupees and upwards.”</li>
</ul>
<p>Yellapu Uma Maheswari v. Buddha Jagadheeswararao, (2015) 16 SCC 787, is an authority to see, what is ‘collateral purpose’. It is held that following matters can be proved with an unregistered partition deed, as ‘collateral purpose’- </p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>severancy of title, </li>
<li>nature of possession of various shares;
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>but not primary purpose, i.e. <span style="text-decoration: underline">division of joint properties by metes and bounds</span>. </li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>It is held as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li class="has-small-font-size">“In a suit for partition, an unregistered document can be relied upon for collateral purpose i.e. <span style="text-decoration: underline">severancy of title, nature of possession of various shares but not for the primary purpose i.e. division of joint properties by metes and bounds</span>. An unstamped instrument is not admissible in evidence even for collateral purpose, until the same is impounded. Hence, if the appellant-defendant wants to mark these documents for collateral purpose it is open for them to pay the stamp duty together with penalty and get the document impounded and the trial court is at liberty to mark Exts. B-21 and B-22 for collateral purpose subject to proof and relevance.” </li>
</ul>
<p>Proviso to Sec. 49 of the Registration Act reads as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><mark class="has-inline-color has-foreground-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Provided that an unregistered document affecting immovable property and required by this Act or the Transfer of Property Act, 1882 (4 of 1882), to be registered may be received as evidence of a contract in a suit for specific performance under Chapter II of the Specific Relief Act, 1877 (3 of 1877), or as evidence of any </mark><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline"><mark class="has-inline-color has-primary-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">collateral transaction </mark>not required to be effected by registered instrument</span></strong>.”</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">Is ‘Impounding’ totally Independent from ‘Admissibility’</span></strong></p>
<p>Karnataka High Court (N. Kumar, J.), in Rekha S. Chandru v. Chikka Venkatappa (2015), authoritatively held relying on Javer Chand v. Pukhraj Surana, AIR 1961 SC 1655, that when a document was already marked by the trial Court in evidence, the objection regarding stamp duty cannot be raised at a later stage. </p>
<p>It further observed (obiter) by the Karnataka High Court that the impounding the document was totally different from admissibility; and therefore, an insufficiently stamped document, if admitted by mistake, was liable to be impounded by the Court and the procedure prescribed in the Stamp Act was to be followed in so far as collection of stamp duty and penalty were concerned. </p>
<p>It appears that the above proposition of the Karnataka High Court has to be evaluated on the touchstone of the Apex Court verdict, <strong>Javer Chand v. Pukhraj Surana</strong>, AIR 1961 SC 1655, which reads as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li class="has-small-font-size">“Once a document has been admitted in evidence, as aforesaid, <span style="text-decoration: underline">it is not open either to the Trial Court itself or to a Court of Appeal or revision to go behind that order</span>. Such an order is not one of those judicial orders which are liable to be reviewed or revised by the same Court or a Court of superior jurisdiction.”</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration:underline">Unstamped or Insufficiently Stamped Pro-note</span></strong></p>
<p>Unstamped or insufficiently stamped promissory note cannot be marked in evidence. The weight of authority is on the side that says it is incurable.  Hence no secondary evidence can also be lead on the same. It cannot be used for collateral purpose also. But the creditor can prosecute a suit upon ‘original consideration’. </p>

<p><strong><span style="text-decoration:underline">Impounding of Documents – When Produced or when Exhibited</span></strong></p>
<p>In Yogesh Kumar Sikka v. Monika (2019) the P &amp; H High Court held as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“12. Court cannot say that it would impound the document only when the document is tendered in evidence for marking. There may be instances where duty and penalty payable may be very high and the party may not choose to rely upon such insufficiently stamped document in order to avoid stamp duty and penalty. In such circumstances, it would result in loss of revenue to the exchequer. The power of impounding a document is to collect stamp duty and penalty whenever there is an escape of duty. Therefore, <span style="text-decoration:underline">when it is brought to the notice of the Court</span> that a document is insufficiently stamped, the Court exercising its power under S. 33 of the Act has to pass an order at the first instance for impounding the document. Though there is a discretion vested in the Court to exercise powers under S. 33 and 34 of the Act, no Court can hold that it would wait till the document is tendered in evidence. In such circumstances, there may be chances of loss of revenue to the exchequer.”</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><u>Copy of a Deed Cannot be Impounded; it cannot be Validated by Impounding</u></strong></p>
<p>In Hariom Agrawal v. Prakash Chand Malviya , AIR 2008 SC 166, it is held as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li class="has-small-font-size">“8. It is clear from the decisions of this Court and a plain reading of Ss. 33, 35 and 2(14) of the Act (Madhya Pradesh Stamp Act) that an instrument which is not duly stamped can be impounded and when the required fee and penalty has been paid for such instrument it can be taken in evidence under Sec. 35 of the Stamp Act. Ss. 33 or 35 are <span style="text-decoration: underline">not concerned with any copy </span>of the instrument and party can only be allowed to rely on the document which is an instrument within the meaning of Sec. 2(14). There is no scope for the inclusion of the copy of the document for the purposes of the Indian Stamp Act. Law is now no doubt well settled that <span style="text-decoration: underline">copy of the instrument cannot be validated by impounding</span> and this cannot be admitted as secondary evidence under the Indian Stamp Act, 1899.”</li>

<p>It is held in <strong>Ameer Minhaj v. Dierdre Elizabeth (Wright) Issar, 2018 (7) SCC  639</strong>, after quoting Sec. 17 Registration Act, as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>10. On a plain reading of this provision, it is amply clear that the document containing contract to transfer the right, title or interest in an immovable property for consideration is required to be registered, if the party wants to rely on the same for the purposes of Section 53A of the 1882 Act to protect its possession over the stated property. If it is not a registered document, the only consequence provided in this provision is to declare that such document shall have no effect for the purposes of the said Section 53A of the 1882 Act.</li>
<li>The issue, in our opinion, is no more res integra. In <strong>S. Kaladevi Vs. V.R. Somasundaram and Ors</strong>., (2010) 5 SCC 401, this Court has restated the legal position that when an unregistered sale deed is tendered in evidence, not as evidence of a completed sale, but as proof of an oral agreement of sale, the deed can be received as evidence <span style="text-decoration:underline">making an endorsement</span> that it is <strong><mark class="has-inline-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#0417f4">received only as evidence of an oral agreement of sale</mark></strong> under the proviso to Section 49 of the 1908 Act. </li>

Development Consultant Limited, (2008) 8 SCC 564 and has added one more principle  thereto that <span style="text-decoration:underline">a document is <strong><mark class="has-inline-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#c704d4">required to be registered, but  if unregistered</mark></strong>, can still be <mark class="has-inline-color has-foreground-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">admitted as evidence of a contract </mark>in a suit for specific performance. </span>In view of this exposition, the conclusion recorded by the High Court in the impugned judgment that the sale agreement dated 9th July, 2003 is inadmissible in evidence, will have to be understood to mean that the document though exhibited, will bear an endorsement that it is admissible only as evidence of the agreement to sell under the proviso to Section 49 of the 1908  Act and shall not have any effect for the purposes of  Section 53A of the 1882 Act. In that, it is r<strong>eceived as evidence of a contract in a suit for specific performance and nothing more</strong>. The genuineness, validity and binding nature of the document or the fact that it is hit by the provisions of the 1882 Act or the 1899 Act, as the case may be, will have to be adjudicated at the appropriate stage as noted by the Trial Court after the parties adduce oral and documentary evidence.”</li>

<p>In C.  Ramya Vs.

<p><strong><span style="text-decoration:underline">Unregd. Partition Deed Admissible to see Severance &amp; No Suit for Partition lie</span></strong></p>
<p>In Chinnapareddigari Pedda Muthyalareddy v. Chinnappareddigari Venkatareddy,<strong> </strong>AIR 1969 AP 242, unregistered partition lists were drawn up showing the properties allotted to the respective sharers. The lists were construed as partition deeds and were held by the trial Court to be inadmissible in evidence for proving division by metes and bounds. No oral evidence was held to be admissible under section 91 of the Evidence Act to prove the factum of partition or the nature of possession. In appeal the Andhra Pradesh High Court (FB-Jaganmohan Reddy, C.J.) held that the unregistered partition deed was admissible <span style="text-decoration:underline">not for proving terms of the partition</span> or as the source of title, but for the purpose of <span style="text-decoration:underline">showing that there was a disruption (division/severance) in status</span> and that no suit for partition would lie on the basis that the properties were still joint family properties. This decision is relied on in Booraswami v. Rajakannu, 1978-1 MLJ 248; and held further, relying on K. Kanna Reddy v. K. Venkata Reddy, AIR 1965 AP 274, that for determining status and the nature of the possession oral evidence was <em>also</em> admissible (for proving the factum of partition).</p>

</div>
<p>With respect to unregistered documents it is held by the Apex Court in <strong>K.B. Saha and Sons Private Limited v. Development Consultant Ltd,</strong>  (2008) 8 SCC 564:  2008 AIR SCW 4829, held as under:</p>
</div>
<ul class="has-small-font-size wp-block-list">
<li>“34. From the principles laid down in the various decisions of this Court and the High Courts, as referred to here-in-above, it is evident that :</li>
<li>A document required to be registered is not admissible into evidence under section 49 of the Registration Act.</li>
<li>Such unregistered document can however <span style="text-decoration:underline">be used as an evidence of collateral purpose</span> as provided in the Proviso to section 49 of the Registration Act. ….”</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>In the light of the Supreme Court decision in <strong>K.B. Saha and Sons Private Limited</strong> , it appears that the observation of the Karnataka High Court in Nanda Behera v. Akhsaya Kumar Behera, 2017AIR (CC) 1893, that once the Court, rightly or wrongly, decides to admit the documents in evidence, so far as the parties are concerned, the matter is closed, is <span style="text-decoration:underline">not applicable to unregistered</span> (compulsorily registrable) <span style="text-decoration:underline">documents</span>.</p>
<p>However, the Calcutta High Court in Dipak Kumar Singh v. Park Street Properties (P) Limited, AIR 2014 Cal 167, distinguished K.B. Saha &amp; Sons Private Limited, (2008) 8 SCC 564, and other decisions saying that ‘the question of admissibility of a document, which had been admitted in evidence, was not taken up for consideration’ in those decisions. The High Court relied on Javer Chand v. Pukhraj Surana, AIR 1961 SC 1655 (<span style="font-size:revert;background-color:var(--global--color-background);color:var(--global--color-foreground);font-family:var(--global--font-secondary)">question as to admissibility on the </span>ground that it has not been stamped), which held that once a document had been marked as an exhibit in a case and the trial had proceeded all along on the footing that the document was an exhibit in the case and had been used by the parties in examination and cross-examination of their witnesses, it was not open either to the trial court itself or to a court of appeal or revision to go behind that order.</p>
