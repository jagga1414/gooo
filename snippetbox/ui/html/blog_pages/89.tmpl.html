<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">The ‘Ingredients’ of Adverse Possession</span></strong></p>
<p>The authoritative decisions of our Apex Court made it clear that the following  are the basic elements (1963 Limitation Act) to attract Adverse Possession –</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><em>The claimant has been in ‘<strong>hostile </strong>and <strong>open, continuous uninterrupted </strong></em><strong>as of right</strong><em>‘ possession of the land,</em></li>
<li><em>in <strong>denial of the title</strong></em> of the rightful owner,</li>
<li><strong><em>adversely</em></strong><em> to the interest</em> of the owner <em>of the land</em>,</li>
<li><strong><em>started </em></strong>with wrongful <strong><em><mark class="has-inline-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#1123f2">dispossession</mark></em></strong> of the rightful owner 
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>(Note: Article 65, Limitation Act says – period 12 years from <strong><em>dispossession</em></strong>),</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><em>exercising <strong>absolute rights</strong> of ownership in respect of the land</em>, and</li>
<li><em> on and from </em>.. . .. (<em><strong><mark class="has-inline-color has-primary-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">date</mark></strong></em>).</li>
</ul>
<p>And, it is appropriate to plead ‘hostile and open’ possession as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Claimant’s acts were<strong> hostile enough</strong> to make the true owner aware of the adverse possession;</li>
<li>or, the claimant <strong><em>made the true owner knew</em> </strong>as to his hostile acts or adverse possession (from the inception).</li>
</ul>
<p>In Dagadabai v. Abbas alias Gulab Rustum Pinjari, (2017) 13 SCC 705, it is observed as under: </p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“It is equally well-settled that such person must necessarily <span style="text-decoration: underline">first admit the ownership of the true owner</span> over the property <span style="text-decoration: underline">to the </span><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline"><mark class="has-inline-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#cf2e2e">knowledge of the true owner</mark></span> </strong>and <span style="text-decoration: underline">secondly, the</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline">true owner has to be made a party</span> to the suit to enable the Court to decide the plea of adverse possession between the two rival claimants.”</li>
</ul>
<p>The celebrated decisions that analyzed the ‘ingredients’ of Adverse Possession are –</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Government of Kerala v. Joseph, 2023 KHC OnLine 6764.</li>

</ul>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline">‘<strong>Dispossession</strong>‘ implies <strong>ouster</strong></span></p>
<p>It is clear from the above decisions that ‘<strong>dispossession’ </strong>(of the true owner) implies <strong>ouster</strong> itself. However, (i) the quality of evidence expected as to  ‘<strong>dispossession’ </strong>in cases of adverse possession, against a co-owner, or in case of a permissive-possession, stands on a ‘higher footing’; and (ii) this is particularly discerned as ‘<strong>ouster</strong>‘. (See: Vidya Devi @ Vidya Vati v. Prem Prakash, AIR 1995 SC 1789, 1995-4 SCC 496.)</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline"><span style="text-decoration: underline">What is <strong>ouster</strong></span>? </span></strong></p>
<p>“Black’s Law Dictionary” explains ‘<strong>ouster</strong>‘ as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“A putting out; <strong>dispossession</strong>; amotion of possession. A species of injuries to things real, by which the wrong-doer gains actual occupation of the land, and compels the rightful owner to seek his legal remedy in order to gain possession.</li>
<li>An “ouster” is a wrongful <strong>dispossession</strong> or exclusion of a party from real property and involves a question of intent.</li>
<li>Notorious and unequivocal act by which one cotenant deprives another of right to common and equal possession and enjoyment of property.” </li>
</ul>
<p>Webster’s New World Law Dictionary expounds ‘ouster’ as under: </p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“<strong>Ouster</strong>: n. 1 The wrongful exclusion of a person from property or <strong>dispossession</strong> of same. 2 The removing from office of a public or corporate official.”</li>
</ul>
<p>In P Ramanatha Aiyar’s “The Law Lexicon” with Legal Maxims, Latin Terms and Words &amp; Phrases, Second Edition 1997) it is laid down-</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline">“Dispossession” implies <strong>ouster</strong></span><strong>,</strong> and the essence of ouster lies in that the person ousting is in actual possession. </li>
<li>Dispossession implies some active element in the mind of a person in ousting or dislodging or depriving a person against his will or counsel and there must be some sort of action on his part.” (Quoted in: U. P.  Gandhi Smarak Nidhi v. Aziz Mian, 2013-3 ADJ 321, 2013-4 All LJ 149)</li>
</ul>
<p>In “Mitra’s Legal and Commercial Dictionary” 5th Edition (1990) by A.N. Saha, ‘Dispossession’ is explained as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“The term ‘dispossession’ applies when a person comes in and drives out others from possession. <span style="text-decoration: underline">It imports<strong> ouster</strong></span>; a driving out of possession against the will of the person in actual possession.” (Quoted in: U. P.  Gandhi Smarak Nidhi v. Aziz Mian, 2013-3 ADJ 321, 2013-4 All LJ 149)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><u>Denial of Title of the True Owner</u></strong></p>
<p>In Kurella Naga Druva Vudaya Bhaskara Rao v. Galla Jani Kamma Alias Nacharamma, (2008) 15 SCC 150, it was pointed out – if according to the defendant, the plaintiff was not the true owner, his possession would not have been sufficient to term it ‘hostile’ to the plaintiff’s title; and that the defendant had to show, to attract adverse possession, that his possession was also hostile to the title and possession of the true owner.</p>
<p><strong><u>It not sure who the true owner is, there will be no Adverse Possession</u></strong></p>
<p>Adverse possession is hostile possession which is expressly or impliedly in denial of title of the true owner. To attract adverse possession there must be animus possidendi to hold the land adverse to the title of the true owner (Chatti Konati Rao v. Palle Venkata Subba Rao, 2010-14 SCC 316; M. Venkatesh v. BDA, 2015-17 SCC 1; Brijesh Kumar v. Shardabai, 2019-9 SCC 369) with the knowledge of the true owner. If the defendants are not sure who the true owner is, there will be no question of possessing the property hostile to the true owner (T. Anjanappa v. Somalingappa, 2006-7 SCC 570; Uttam Chand v. Nathu Ram, 2020-11 SCC 263, AIR  2020 SC 46).</p>
<p><strong><u>Claimant must have accepted title of the true owner</u></strong></p>
<p>It is a basic factor in adverse possession- the claimant thereof must have accepted the title of the true owner.</p>
<p>In Nand Ram v.  Jagdish Prasad, (2020) 9 SCC 393, it was pointed out by the Apex Court :</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>The question of adverse possession <strong>without admitting the title of the real owner </strong>is not tenable.  </li>
</ul>
<p>In Uttam Chand v. Nathu Ram, 2020-11 SCC 263, AIR  2020 SC 461, our Apex Court allowed the appeal, negating the claim of adverse possession raised by the defendant, inter alia, for not accepting the title of the plaintiff (true owner), by the defendant. It was observed  as under: “16. In the present case, the defendants have not admitted the vesting of the suit property with the Managing Officer and the factum of its transfer in favour of the plaintiff. The defendants have denied the title not only of the Managing Officer</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">Legal ramifications of ‘Ouster’ in  Adverse Possession</span></strong></p>
<p>The simple word meaning of the term ‘<strong>ouster</strong>‘ is <strong>dispossession</strong>, removal, eviction, deprivation etc. It is definite that “<strong>dispossession</strong>” is an important element in the 1963 Limitation Act to attract Adverse Possession. </p>
<p>Legal ramifications of <strong>‘ouster</strong>‘ is examined in Vidya Devi @ Vidya Vati v. Prem Prakash, AIR 1995 SC 1789, 1995-4 SCC 496. It is held as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>” ‘<strong>Ouster</strong>’ does not mean actual driving out of the co- sharer from the property. It will, however, <span style="text-decoration: underline">not be complete unless it is coupled with all other ingredients</span> required to constitute <span style="text-decoration: underline">adverse possession</span>. Broadly speaking, three elements are necessary for establishing the <span style="text-decoration: underline">plea of <strong>ouster</strong> in the case of <strong>co-owner</strong></span>. They are –
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>(i) declaration of <span style="text-decoration: underline">hostile animus</span></li>
<li>(ii) <span style="text-decoration: underline">long and uninterrupted possession</span> of the person pleading <strong>ouster</strong> and</li>
<li>(iii) <span style="text-decoration: underline">exercise of right of exclusive ownership openly and to the </span><strong><mark class="has-inline-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#cf2e2e"><span style="text-decoration: underline">knowledge</span> of other co-owner</mark>.</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Thus, a co-owner, can under law, claim title by adverse possession against another co-owner who can, of course, file appropriate suit including suit for joint possession within time prescribed by law.”</li>
</ul>
<p>From Vidya Devi @ Vidya Vati v. Prem Prakash it is clear that, in our law, ‘<strong>ouster</strong>‘ is a compendium of all ingredients to attract  Adverse Possession. </p>
<p><span><b><u>Permissive Possession will not </u></b></span><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">bring-forth Adverse Possession</span></strong></p>
<p>When the old Limitation Act of 1908 reigned, our Apex Court, in P. Lakshmi Reddy v. L. Lakshmi Reddy, AIR 1957 SC 314, following Debendra Lal Khan case, (1933-34) 61 IA 78 : AIR 1934 PC 23], observed as under :</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“4. … But it is well-settled that in order to establish <span style="text-decoration: underline">adverse possession of one coheir as against another</span> it is not enough to show that one out of them is in sole possession and enjoyment of the profits, of the properties. <span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Ouster </strong>of the non-possessing co-heir</span> by the co-heir in possession who claims his possession to be adverse, <span style="text-decoration: underline">should be made out</span>. The possession of one co-heir is considered, in law, as possession of all the co-heirs. When one co-heir is found to be in possession of the properties it is presumed to be on the basis of joint title. The co-heir in possession cannot render his possession adverse to the other co-heir not in possession merely by any secret hostile animus on his own part in derogation of the other co-heir’s title. <span style="text-decoration: underline">It is a settled rule of law </span>that as between co-heirs there must be evidence of open assertion of hostile title, coupled with exclusive possession and enjoyment by one of them to the <mark class="has-inline-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#cf2e2e"><strong>knowledge of the other</strong></mark> <span style="text-decoration: underline">so as to constitute <strong>ouster.</strong></span> … the burden of making out <strong>ouster</strong> is on the person claiming to displace the lawful title of a co-heir by his adverse possession.” (Quoted in: Hemaji Waghaji Jat v. Bhikabhai Khengarbhai Harijan, (2009) 16 SCC 517).</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline">Amimus and Adverse Possession</span></p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>In <span style="text-decoration: underline">L.N. Aswathama v. P. Prakash </span> (2009) 13 SCC 229 it is held – <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">permissive possession </span></strong>or possession in the absence of <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">Animus possidendi</span> </strong>would not constitute the claim of adverse possession.</li>
<li>In <span style="text-decoration: underline">Thakur Kishan Singh v. Arvind Kumar </span>(1994) 6 SCC 591 it is held – possession of a <span style="text-decoration: underline">co-owner or of a licensee or of an agent</span> or a <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">permissive possession</span></strong> to become adverse <span style="text-decoration: underline">must show <strong>hostile animus</strong></span><strong> </strong>and possession<span style="text-decoration: underline"> adverse to the <mark class="has-inline-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#cf2e2e"><strong>knowledge of real owner</strong></mark></span>. <span style="text-decoration: underline">Mere possession for howsoever length of time</span> does not result in converting the <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">permissive possession</span> </strong>into adverse possession.</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>1908 Limitation Act</strong></span> – ‘<span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Ouster’ Needed against co-owner (for adverse possession</strong></span>)</p>
<p>Under 1908 Limitation Act, the the true owner lost the right to recover property if he did not come-forward with a suit for recovery within 12 years. </p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong><sup>Note:</sup></strong> <sup><span><b>(i) Under 1908 Limitation Act, ‘dispossession’ of true owner was </b><span style="font-weight: bold;text-decoration: underline">not </span><b>a necessary requirement to attract Adverse Possession. (ii) But, under 1963 Limitation Act, ‘dispossession’ of true owner is a decisive </b></span><strong>requisite to attract Adverse Possession.</strong></sup></li>
</ul>
<p>Permissive possession will not bring-in Adverse Possession. Therefore, under 1908 Limitation Act, plea and proof of <strong>ouster</strong> were insisted when one pleaded adverse possession against a <span style="text-decoration: underline">co-owner</span>; that is, positive and specific overt acts, ousting co-owner from possession, were imperative; and mere<strong> </strong>hostile acts of adverse possession were not enough<em> </em>(See: Velliyottummel Sooppi v. Nadukandy Moossa, AIR 1969 Ker 222).</p>
<p>Privy Council in Coera v. Appuhamy, AIR 1914 PC 243 held as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“Entering into possession and having a lawful title to enter, he could not divest himself of that title by pretending that he had no title as all. His title must have ensured for the benefit of his co-proprietors. </li>
<li>The principle recognised by Wood, V.C. in Thomas Vs. Thomas (1856) 25 LJ Ch 159 (161): 110 RR 107 holds good: ‘Possession is never considered adverse if it can be referred to a lawful title’….. </li>
<li>His possession was, in law, the possession of his co-owners. It was not possible for him to put an end to that possession by any secret intention in his mind. Nothing short of <strong>ouster</strong> or something equivalent to<strong> ouster</strong> could bring about that result.”<strong> </strong>(Quoted in: Vidya Devi @ Vidya Vati v. Prem Prakash, AIR 1995 SC 1789, 1995-4 SCC   496. See also: <mark class="has-inline-color has-foreground-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Kshithish Chandra Bose v.

<p><strong><u>Article 142 of the (Repealed) Limitation Act, 1908</u></strong></p>
<p>Article 142 of the (repealed) Limitation Act, 1908, which dealt with Adverse Possession, did not put down the term ‘adverse’. </p>
<p>Article 142 of the Limitation Act, 1908 reads as under:</p>

<p>Article 142 of the Limitation Act, 1908 provided that the true owner would lose his right to recover the property from a trespasser if he failed to file a suit within the period of 12 years.</p>
<p><strong><u><mark class="has-inline-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#2317ee"><strong><u>Art. 65 of Limitation. Act, 1963</u></strong></mark></u></strong></p>

<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Both these Articles are attracted when the plaintiff has been dispossessed by the defendant.</li>
<li>Both articles deal with limitation for suits for recovery of possession.</li>
<li>Both are independent and apply two different situations.</li>
<li>In both these cases the defendant can rely on his title; or “perfection” of title by ‘adverse possession’, because, by virtue of extinguishment of title of the owner, the person in possession acquires absolute title (Ravinder Kaur Grewal v.

<p>Article 64</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">

<li>Article 64 is <strong><u>not </u></strong>based on <strong>title</strong> of plaintiff (But, it can be possessory title).</li>
<li>Article 64 applies only if the plaintiff lost possession within 12 years (in other words, he must have been in possession of the property within twelve years prior to suit. (Tribeni v. Soaroop, AIR 1911 Raj 232)  </li>
<li>Under Article 64, it is unnecessary to inquire – whether the defendant’s possession was ‘adverse’. (Muhammad Amanullah v. Badan Singh (1889) ILR l7 Cal 137 (PC).</li>
<li>Under Article 64 the nature of the plaintiffs possession is not material. Article 65 specifically refers to “immovable property or any interest therein” whereas Article 64 mentions only “immovable property”. So the interest in immovable properly stands outside the scope of that article.</li>
</ul>
<p>Article 65</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Article 65 deals with recovery based <strong>on title</strong>.</li>
<li>Under Article 65 previous possession of plaintiff (within twelve years) need <strong><u>not</u></strong> be proved. It is immaterial. (Ramiah v. N.

<li>Under Article 65, if plaintiff could prove his title, it would fail only if the defendant proves adverse possession over twelve years. (Bhushan Lal v. Suresh Kumar, AIR 1987 All 25,  Manikyala Rao v. Narasimhaswrami, AIR 1996 SC 470.)</li>
<li>Under Article 65, if plaintiff could <strong>not</strong> prove his <strong>title</strong>, he will fail (and in such a case, whether the defendant proves title or adverse possession is immaterial). (Ranjit Kumar Bhowmik v.  Subodh Kumar Roy, (2004) I WBLR 228: (2004) 2 CHN 180)</li>

<li>Second, the court has to raise an issue on title on adverse possession (if no declaration of title is sought for, by way of counter claim), and direct the defendant to pay court fees as provided in the Court Fees Act (i.e., as provided for in the Section pertaining to ‘Court fee for Injunction’).</li>
<li>Third, Declaration is necessary.</li>
</ul>
<p>It appears that the first view is the most reasonable and cogent one. Because,  Article 65 itself provides that the plaintiff would fail if the defendant proves adverse possession over twelve years. Sec. 27 also confers a vested right. It reads as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>27. <span style="text-decoration: underline">Extinguishment of right to property</span>—At the determination of the period hereby limited to any person for instituting a suit for possession of any property, his right to such property shall be extinguished.</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Burden/Onus of Proof – Complete change by</strong> <strong>Limitation Act, 1963</strong></span></p>
<p>In the recent decision, Government of Kerala v. Joseph, 2023 KHC OnLine 6764, our Apex Court observed that burden of proof rests on the person claiming adverse possession. The Court followed <strong>P.T. Munichikkanna Reddy v. Revamma</strong>, (2007) 6 SCC 59, which observed as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“34. The law in this behalf has undergone a change. In terms of Articles 142 and 144 of the Limitation Act, 1908, the burden of proof was on the plaintiff to show within 12 years from the date of institution of the suit that he had title and possession of the land, whereas in terms of Articles 64 and 65 of the Limitation Act, 1963, the legal position has underwent <strong>complete change insofar as the onus is concerned</strong>: once a party proves its title, the onus of proof would be on the other party to prove claims of title by adverse possession….”</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><u>Claim of Adverse Possession on Govt. Land –  be Considered “More Seriously”</u></strong></p>
<p>In the recent decision (August 9, 2023), Govt. of Kerala v. Joseph, 2023 KHC OnLine 6764, our Apex Court has emphasised, that the Courts have to consider the question of adverse possession “more seriously” when it is claimed on a land that belongs to the Government. In this case, the judgment of the first appellate court which observed that ‘the title of the Government on land cannot be lost by placing reliance on “casual advertence” or on the basis of “scanty material” ’ was restored by the Apex Court.  The Apex Court held –</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“When the land subject of proceedings wherein adverse possession has been claimed, belongs to the Government, the Court is duty-bound to act with greater seriousness, effectiveness, care and circumspection as it may lead to destruction of a right/title of the State to immovable property.”</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><u>Date of Adverse Possession &amp; <mark class="has-inline-color has-primary-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Knowledge to the True Owner</mark> etc.</u></strong></p>
<p>Chatti Konati Rao v. Palle Venkata Subba Rao, (2010) 14 SCC 316 explored Animus possidendi as a requisite ingredient of adverse possession. It was found that a mere possession does not ripen into possessory title until the possessor holds the property adverse to the title of the true owner. The <strong><u>date </u></strong>on which he came in possession, nature of possession, the factum of possession, <strong><mark class="has-inline-color has-primary-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">knowledge to the true owner</mark></strong>, duration of possession and that possession was open and undisturbed – must be established. (Referred to in: Brijesh Kumar v. Shardabai, (2019) 9 SCC 369; Uttam Chand v. Nathu Ram, 2020-11 SCC 263, AIR  2020 SC 46).</p>
<p><strong><u>Owner “<mark class="has-inline-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#6300bf">not take care to know notorious facts</mark>”  and hostile colour of title, required</u></strong></p>
<p>In P Lakshmi Reddy v. L Lakshmi Reddy, 1957 SCR 195, it was observed as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“7…Consonant with this principle the commencement of adverse possession, in favour of a person implies that the person is in actual possession, at the time, <strong><u>with a notorious hostile claim</u></strong> of exclusive title, to repel which, the true <strong><u><mark class="has-inline-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#7207d6">owner would then be in a position to maintain an action</mark></u></strong>. It would follow that whatever may be the animus or intention of a person wanting to acquire title by adverse possession his adverse possession cannot commence until he obtains actual possession <strong><u>with the requisite animus</u></strong>.” (Quoted in: M Siddiq v. Mahant Suresh Das, 2020-1 SCC 1)</li>
</ul>
<p>Ravinder Kaur Grewal v. Manjit Kaur, (2019) 8 SCC 729, has held as under: </p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“60. The adverse possession requires all the three classic requirements to co-exist at the same time, namely, nec vi i.e. adequate in continuity, nec clam i.e. adequate in publicity and nec precario i.e. adverse to a competitor, in <mark class="has-inline-color has-primary-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><strong>denial of title and his knowledge</strong>.</mark> Visible, notorious and peaceful <strong><mark class="has-inline-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#7e0bea">so that if the <span style="text-decoration: underline">owner does not take care to know notorious facts</span></mark></strong>, knowledge is attributed to him on the basis that but for due diligence he would have known it. Adverse possession cannot be decreed on a title which is not pleaded. Animus possidendi <span style="text-decoration: underline">under hostile colour of title </span>is required. Trespasser’s long possession is not synonymous with adverse possession…”</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><u>No Equities in favour of a Person Pleading Adverse Possession</u></strong></p>
<p>In Chatti Konati Rao v. Palle Venkata Subba Rao, (2010) 14 SCC 316, it is observed as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“A person pleading adverse possession has no equities in his favour as he is trying to defeat the rights of the true owner and, hence, it is for him to clearly plead and establish all facts necessary to establish adverse possession. The courts always take unkind view towards statutes of limitation overriding property rights. The plea of adverse possession is not a pure question of law but a blended one of fact and law.”</li>
