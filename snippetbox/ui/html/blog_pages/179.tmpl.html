<p><strong><u>PRODUCTION,  ADMI<span class="uppercase">SSIBILITY </span>&amp; PROOF</u><span style="text-decoration:underline"> OF DOCUMENTS</span></strong></p>
<p>A document to be used in court has to pass through three steps. They are:</p>
<ol class="has-small-font-size wp-block-list">
<li>Production of documents in court</li>
<li>Admittance and exhibition</li>
<li>Proof (formal proof and truth of contents).</li>
</ol>
<p><span style="text-decoration:underline"><strong>Production and Admittance of evidence</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration:underline">Order VII rule 14,  Order VIII rule 8A ,  Order XIII rule 1</span> say as to ‘<span style="text-decoration:underline"><strong>Production</strong>‘ of documents</span> in court. At this stage the opposite party may not have a role to object. But the Court or even the office of the court (registry) can raise and note objection on the ground of insufficiency of stamp by virtue of the provisions of the Stamp Act concerned.</p>
<p> <span style="text-decoration:underline">Order XIII rule 4</span>  requires following endorsements on every document which has been <span style="text-decoration:underline"><strong>admitted</strong> in evidence</span> in the Suit:</p>
<ul class="has-small-font-size wp-block-list">
<li>(a) the number and title of the suit,</li>
<li>(b) the name of the person producing the document,</li>
<li>(c) the date on which it was produced, and</li>
<li>(d) a statement of its having been so admitted.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><u>Proof – Two Types:</u></strong></p>
<p style="line-height:1.5"><span style="text-decoration:underline">First</span>,<strong><span style="text-decoration:underline"> </span></strong><span style="text-decoration:underline">Formal Proof</span>: Proof as to <span style="text-decoration:underline">existence of the document</span>. The modes of proof of documents are governed under Sec. 64 to 73A of the Evd. Act.</p>
<p style="line-height:1.5"><span style="text-decoration:underline">Second</span>, <span style="text-decoration:underline">Substantive Proof</span>:  Proof as to <span style="text-decoration:underline">truth of the contents</span> document. Besides the formal proof, in most cases (excepting a few cases where signature, hand-writing etc. alone are considered), the court <em><u>acts upon</u></em> a document, only when ‘truth’ of the same is established. Generally speaking, proof as to truth is to be established-</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>(i) by oral evidence of one who can vouchsafe the same or</li>
<li>(ii) by circumstantial evidence or</li>
<li>(iii) by invoking ‘presumption’ or</li>
<li>(iv) by express admission by the other side.</li>
</ul>
<p style="line-height:1.3"><strong><u>Modes of Proof of Documents</u></strong></p>
<p>Modes of Proof of Documents (as to, both, ‘formal proof’ and ‘truth of the contents’)  include the following:</p>
<ul class="has-small-font-size wp-block-list">
<li><span style="text-decoration:underline">Admission </span>of the person who wrote or signed the document (Sec.  17, 21, 58, 67, 70).</li>
<li>Evidence of a person <span style="text-decoration:underline">in whose presence</span> the document was signed or written – ocular evidence (Sec. 59).</li>
<li>An <span style="text-decoration:underline">attesting witness</span> (Sec. 59). </li>
<li>Opinion of a person who is <span style="text-decoration:underline">acquainted</span> with the writing of the person who signed or wrote (Sec. 47).</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration:underline">Admission </span>made by the person who signed or wrote the document made in <span style="text-decoration:underline">judicial proceedings</span> (Sec. 32, 33).</li>
<li>Evidence of a handwriting <span style="text-decoration:underline">expert</span>-opinion evidence/scientific evidence (Sec.45).</li>
<li>Evidence of a person who in routine has been receiving the document; or a document signed by such a person in the ordinary <span style="text-decoration:underline">course of his business</span> or official duty, though he may have never seen the author signing the document (Sec. 32, 34, 35 or 114).</li>
<li>Invoking (specific) <span style="text-decoration:underline">presumptions </span>under Sec. 79 to 90A.</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration:underline">Presumptions</span> (general) under Sec. 114.</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration:underline">Circumstantial evidence</span>: on probability or inferences (Sec. 114). </li>
<li>Court-<span style="text-decoration:underline">comparison</span> (Sec. 73).</li>
<li>Facts <span style="text-decoration:underline">judicially noticeable</span> (Sec.  56 and 57).</li>
<li>A fact of <span style="text-decoration:underline">common-knowledge</span>. (It does not require proof. See: Union Of India Vs. Virendra Bharti: 2011-2 ACC 886, 2010  ACJ 2353; Rakhal Chakraborty Vs. Sanjib Kumar Roy: 1998-1 GauLR 253, 1997-2 GauLT 705)</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration:underline">Internal evidence</span> afforded by the contents of the document; a link in a chain of correspondence; recipient of the documen<em>t. </em> (Mobarik Ali Ahmed Vs. State of Bombay, AIR 1957 SC 857)  </li>
</ul>
<p><strong><u>Modes of Proof of Documents ‘Required By Law To Be Attested’</u></strong></p>
<p>Section 68 of the Evd. Act provides that the documents required by law to be attested shall not be used in evidence until at least one attesting witness has been examined, if there be </p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>(i) an attesting witness alive, </li>
<li>(ii) he is subject to the process of court and </li>
<li>(iii) he is capable of giving evidence. </li>
</ul>
<p>But, the proviso lays down that if its execution is not specifically denied by the person by whom it purports to have been executed, it shall not be necessary to call an attesting witness in proof of the execution of any document <em>not being a Will </em>if such document is registered in accordance with the provisions of Indian Registration Act, 1908. That is, for the purpose of proving the Will, the examination of the attesting witness is necessary.</p>
<p>Following documents are required by law to be attested by two or more attesting witnesses.</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>1. Will: section 63 of the Succession Act.</li>
<li>2. Mortgage deed: section 59 of the T P Act.</li>
<li>3. Gift deed: section 123 of the T P Act.</li>
<li>4. Bond:  2(5) of the Indian Stamp Act, 1899.</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="text-decoration:underline"><strong>Presumption</strong></span><strong><u> and Truth </u></strong></p>
<p>St. of West Bengal Vs. Mir Mohammad Omar (AIR 2000 SC 2988) it is held by our Apex Court as under:</p>
<ul class="has-small-font-size wp-block-list">
<li><span style="text-decoration:underline">“Presumption of fact is an inference</span> as to the existence of one fact <span style="text-decoration:underline">from the existence of some other facts</span>, unless the truth of such inference is disproved. Presumption of fact is a rule in law of evidence that a fact otherwise doubtful may be inferred from certain other proved facts. When inferring the existence of a fact from other set of proved facts, the Court exercises a process of reasoning and reach a logical conclusion as the most probable position. The above principle has gained legislative recognition in India when <span style="text-decoration:underline">Section 114</span> is incorporated in the Evidence Act. It empowers the Court to presume the existence of any fact which it thinks likely to have happened. In that process Court shall have <span style="text-decoration:underline">regard to the common course of natural events</span>, human conduct etc. in relation to the facts of the case.”</li>
</ul>
<p>In Dalchand Mulchand v. Hasanbi AIR 1938 Nag 152 (Vivian Bose and Puranik JJ.) held as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li class="has-small-font-size">“The initial burden of proving execution of a document when it is denied is upon the person alleging execution. But if nothing else is known the <span style="text-decoration:underline">mere fact that a document is admitted to bear a certain signature</span> and that it comes from proper custody ought to be enough to raise an inference that it was signed with the intention of execution. This <span style="text-decoration:underline">inference arises in India directly from Sec. 114, Evidence Act</span>. Persons do not ordinarily sign documents without intending to execute them: that is not the common course of human conduct, nor yet the common course their public or private business. Consequently if any person wants to rely on an exceptional circumstance, if he wants to show that in some particular instance the ordinary rule was abrogated surely he must prove it and thus the burden shifts on him”.</li>

<p><strong><u>Probative</u></strong><strong><u> Value of Documents</u></strong></p>
<p>Origin of ‘Probative’ is from ‘Probare’ (Latin), means to prove; and ‘Probatio’ (Latin), means experience, trial, proof, testing, probation etc. In law, the meaning of ‘probative value’ is –</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Sufficiency of evidence which is useful to prove something in a trial.</li>
<li>Probability of proof or truth while appreciating a fact.  </li>
<li>Value or weight of evidence, considered by the court, in proof of something.</li>
<li>Extent of evidentiary value that can be taken to prove a proffered proposition.</li>
</ul>
<p>Whenever a document is admitted in court, the probative value thereof will be a matter for the court to determine.</p>
<p>State of Bihar v. Radha Krishna Singh, AIR 1983 SC 684, it is observed:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“Admissibility of a document is one thing and its probative value quite another—these two aspects cannot be combined. A document may be admissible and yet may not carry any conviction and weight or its probative value may be nil.”</li>
</ul>
<p>E.g. – Photocopy of a deed certified copy of which is provided in law, ‘objectionable document’ marked without objection, un-cross-examined testimony of a witness  etc.</p>
<p><strong><u>Date of Birth – School Admission Register has More Probative Value Than Horoscope</u></strong></p>
<p>If there is a dispute regarding age, the Supreme Court, in State of Punjab v. Mohinder Singh, AIR 2005 SC 1868, held that the date of birth available in the School Admission Register has more probative value than the horoscope. The probative value of FIR, Scene-Mahazar, Post-Mortem Report, Photocopy of a Registered Deed, etc., by itself, will be lesser. In such cases the court can refrain from acting upon such documents until substantive or regular evidence is offered by examining proper witness.</p>
<p>In Om Prakash v. State of Punjab, 1993(2) CLR 395, and in Jora Singh v. State of Punjab, 1984(2) Crimes 837, it has been held that an entry in the school leaving certificate regarding date of birth of a student is not a conclusive proof or high ‘<em>probity</em> <em>evidence’</em>because it is a matter of common knowledge that the date of birth given at the time of the admission of a boy or girl in a school is seldom correct and more often than not the age given is less than the actual age of the child. (See also: C. Doddanarayana Reddy v. C. Jayarama Reddy, AIR 2020 SC 1912; Commissioner of Central Excise And Service Tax v. M/S. Sanjivani Non-Ferrous Trading: AIR 2019 SC 203.)</p>
<p><strong><u>Proof must be by persons who can vouchsafe for the truth</u></strong></p>
<p><em>Narbada Devi Gupta v. Birendra Kumar Jaiswal (2003-8 SCC 745) held:</em></p>
<ul class="has-small-font-size wp-block-list">
<li>“Reliance is heavily placed on behalf of the appellant on <strong>Ramji Dayawala Vs. Invest Import</strong>: AIR 1981 SC 2085.<a href="https://www.scconline.com/blog/post/2020/04/29/practice-and-procedure-relating-to-proof-of-documents/#_ftn25"> </a>The legal position is not in dispute that <span style="text-decoration:underline">mere production</span> and marking of a document as exhibit by the court <span style="text-decoration:underline">cannot be held to be a due proof</span> of its contents.

</ul>
<p style="line-height:1.5">If ‘truth’ is in issue, or in dispute, <em>marking without objection </em>by itself does not absolve the duty to prove the truth as to the contents of the documents.

<p><strong><u>Objection Regarding Admissibility of Documents</u></strong>  – 2 counts </p>
<p>Disputes on admissibility of documents arise on 2 domains. (See: <strong>Manakishore Lalbhai Vs. New Era Fabrics</strong>: AIR 2015 SC 3796)</p>
<ol class="has-small-font-size wp-block-list">
<li>document which is ab initio (or <span style="text-decoration:underline">inherently) ‘inadmissib</span>le’</li>
<li>document liable to be objected on <span style="text-decoration:underline">‘mode or manner of proof</span>’.</li>
</ol>
<p>Even if an inherently-inadmissible document is marked, objections thereto can be raised ‘<span style="text-decoration:underline">at a later stage</span>’. Mode of proof (not inherent admissibility) falls within the realm of procedural law. Therefore, objection thereto can be waived.</p>
<p><strong><u>Inherently-inadmissible documents</u></strong></p>
<p>‘Inherent-inadmissibility of documents’ arises from the following:</p>
<ol class="has-small-font-size wp-block-list">
<li>Irrelevancy</li>
<li>Non-registration.</li>
</ol>
<p>Section 5 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 deals with relevancy. It reads as under:</p>
<ul class="has-small-font-size wp-block-list">
<li>“5. <span style="text-decoration:underline">Evidence may be given of facts in issue and relevant facts</span>.—Evidence may be given in any suit or proceedings of the existence or non-existence of every fact in issue and of such other facts as are hereinafter declared to be relevant, and of no others. </li>
<li>Explanation.—This section shall not enable any person to give evidence of a fact which he is disentitled to prove by any provision of the law for the time being in force relating to Civil Procedure</li>
<li>Illustration s (a) A is tried for the murder of B by beating him with a club with the intention of causing his death. At A’s trial the following facts are in issue:— A’s beating B with the club; A’s causing B’s death by such beating; A’s intention to cause B’s death.  </li>
<li>(b) A suitor does not bring with him, and have in readiness for production at the first hearing of the case, a bond on which he relies. This section does not enable him to produce the bond or prove its contents at a subsequent stage of the proceedings, otherwise than in accordance with the conditions prescribed by the Code of Civil Procedure.”</li>
</ul>
<p>In Jainab Bibi Saheb v. Hyderally Saheb, (1920) 38 MLJ 532, it was pointed out that <span style="text-decoration:underline">neither an omission by an advocate to object</span> to giving of irrelevant and inadmissible evidence<span style="text-decoration:underline"> nor the failure of the tribunal</span> to exclude it of its own motion would <span style="text-decoration:underline">validate a decree based on material</span> which the Evidence Act declares to be<span style="text-decoration:underline"> inherently and in substance irrelevant</span> to the issue. It was also held in this decision that the primary rule to prove relevant facts by the evidence of witnesses is to call them before the trial Judge and examine them viva voce in the manner stated in Chapter 10 of the Evidence Act.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration:underline">Document liable to be Objected on ‘Mode or Manner of Proof’</span></strong></p>
<p>Following are <em>improper</em> modes (liable to objection):</p>
<ul class="has-small-font-size wp-block-list">
<li>Seeking exhibition through <span style="text-decoration:underline">one who cannot vouchsafe veracity or truth.</span></li>
<li>Objectionable (mode of)  <span style="text-decoration:underline">secondary evidence</span>. Eg:
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Certified copy produced <span style="text-decoration:underline">without proving circumstances</span> that entitles to give secondary evidence under <span style="text-decoration:underline">Sec. 65</span> of the Evd. Act.</li>
<li>Secondary evidence other than that is r<span style="text-decoration:underline">ecognised under Sec. 63</span>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Unstamped or insufficiently/improperly stamped document.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><u>Objection to be raised – when document is admitted</u></strong></p>
<p>It was observed by the Supreme Court in 2001 in <strong>Bipin <strong>Shantilal Panchal</strong> v. State of Gujarat</strong>, AIR 2001 SC 1158,  that that ‘it is an archaic practice that during the evidence collecting stage, whenever any objection is raised regarding admissibility of any material in evidence the court does not proceed further without passing order on such objection’. And the Court directed as under:</p>
<ul class="has-small-font-size wp-block-list">
<li>“When so recast, the practice which can be a better substitute is this: Whenever an objection is raised during evidence taking stage regarding the admissibility of any material or item of oral evidence the <span style="text-decoration:underline">trial court can make a note of such objection and mark the objected document</span> tentatively as an exhibit in the case (or record the objected part of the oral evidence) subject to such objections to be decided at the last stage in the final judgment.”</li>
</ul>
<p>But, the subsequent decisions in <strong>RVE Venkatachala Gounder</strong>: AIR 2004 SC 4082; <strong>Dayamathi Bai</strong> (2004) 7  SCC 107 took a contra view. It was held that the objection as to ‘mode of proof’ should be taken <span style="text-decoration:underline">at the time of marking of the document</span> as an exhibit, so that the defect can be cured by the affected party. </p>
<p>Privy Council in <strong>Padman v. Hanwanta, AIR 1915 PC 111, </strong>held that the objection to marking of documents and its admissibility should have been taken in the trial court. It was observed as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“The defendants have now appeal to the Majesty in Council, and the case has been argued on their behalf in great detail. It was urged in the course of the argument that a registered copy of the will of 1898 was admitted in evidence without sufficient foundation being led for its admission. No objection, however, appears to have been taken in the first court against the copy obtained from the Registrar’s office being put in evidence. Had such objection being made at the time, the District Judge, who tried the case in the first instance, would probably have seen that the deficiency was supplied. Their lordships think that there is no substance in the present contention.”</li>
</ul>
<p>In <strong>P.C. Purushothama Reddiar v. S Perumal, 1972 (2) SCR 646, </strong>it was observed as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“Counsel contended that the police reports referred to earlier are inadmissible in evidence as the Head-constables who covered those meetings have not been examined in the case. Those reports were marked without any objection. Hence it is not open to the respondent now to object to their admissibility.”</li>
</ul>
<p>Our Apex Court held in <strong>Lachhmi Narain Singh v. Sarjug Singh</strong>, AIR 2021 SC 3873, as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“24. In view of the foregoing discussion, it is clear that plea regarding mode of proof cannot be permitted to be taken at the <strong><em>appellate stage for the first time</em></strong>, if not raised before the trial Court at the appropriate stage. This is to avoid prejudice to the party who produced the certified copy of an original document without protest by the other side. If such objection was raised before trial court, then the concerned party could have cured the mode of proof by summoning the original copy of document. But such opportunity may not be available or possible at a later stage. Therefore, allowing such objection to be raised during the appellate stage would put the party (who placed certified copy on record instead of original copy) in a jeopardy &amp; would seriously prejudice interests of that party. It will also be inconsistent with the rule of fair play as propounded by Justice Ashok Bhan in the case of RVE Venkatachala Gounder v. Arulmigu, AIR 2003 SC 4548.”</li>

<p><strong><u>If payment of price is disputed, Some Oral Evidence is needed for ‘proof’.</u></strong></p>
<p>In Suresh CV v. Tobin, ILR 2013(1) Ker. 30, the Kerala High Court held that if payment of price for sale was disputed, such fact would not be proved by mere production and marking of a registered sale deed which stated or narrated the payment, and that it was necessary to adduce oral evidence to prove such fact.  The Court relied on Ramji Dayawala Vs. Invest Import (AIR  1981 SC 2085) which held that i<span style="text-decoration:underline">f the truth of the facts stated in a document is in issue</span> mere proof of the handwriting and execution of the document would not furnish evidence of the truth of the facts or contents of the document and that the truth or otherwise of the facts or contents so stated would have<span style="text-decoration:underline"> to be proved by admissible evidence</span> i.e. by the evidence of those persons who can vouchsafe for the truth of the facts in issue.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration:underline">Courts to admit documents Without Proof</span></strong></p>
<p>Section 163 of the Evidence Act, reads as under:</p>
<ul class="has-small-font-size wp-block-list">
<li>163. <span style="text-decoration:underline">Giving, as evidence, of document called for and produced on notice:  </span>When a party calls for a document which he has given the other party notice to produce, and such document is produced and inspected by the party calling for its production, he is bound to give it as evidence if the party producing it requires him to do so.</li>
</ul>
<p>It is observed in Government of Bengal v. Santiram Mondal, AIR 1930 Cal 370, with respect to a document used under Sec. 163, as under:</p>
<ul class="has-small-font-size wp-block-list">
<li>“The further <span style="text-decoration:underline">contention is that</span> if they are to be admitted, they <span style="text-decoration:underline">cannot be</span> put in or at any rate <span style="text-decoration:underline">used without proof</span>. <span style="text-decoration:underline">But the section itself</span> says that the party calling for it is bound to give it as evidence if required to do so, and that certainly <span style="text-decoration:underline">means that it goes in as a record</span> of the particular proceeding and that it can be looked at to see what it includes or omits.”</li>
</ul>
<p>It is noteworthy that Order XI rule 15 and  Order XII rule 8 are the provisions in the CPC to give notice to the other party to produce documents (for ‘inspection’ and ‘show court’, respectively).  In Government of Bengal v. Santiram Mondal, AIR 1930 Cal 370, and R v. Makhan,   AIR 1940 Cal 167, it was observed that  Section 163 of the Evidence Act applies to Criminal Proceedings also. </p>
<p> <strong><span style="text-decoration:underline">Court’s Jurisdiction to Require to Prove an Admitted Document </span></strong></p>
<p>In any case, besides the powers of the court under Sec. 165 of Evidence Act, the scheme of the Procedural Acts (Evidence Act, CPC and CrPC) shows that the court has jurisdiction to require the party concerned to prove that document. We can see it in Sec. 58 of Evidence Act, Order XII, Rule 2A Proviso of the CPC and Sec. 294 of the CrPC . </p>
<p>Section 294 of Code of Criminal Procedure reads as follows:</p>
<ul class="has-small-font-size wp-block-list">
<li>“294. <span style="text-decoration:underline">No formal proof of certain documents</span>. (1) Where any document is filed before any Court by the prosecution or the accused, the particulars of every such document shall be included in a list and the prosecution or the accused, as the case may be, or the pleader for the prosecution or the accused, if any, shall be called upon to admit or deny the genuineness of each such document. </li>
<li>(2) The list of documents shall be in such form as may be prescribed by the State Government. </li>
<li>(3) Where the genuineness of any document is not disputed, such document may be read in evidence in any inquiry, trial or other proceeding under this Code without proof of the signature of the person to whom it purports to be signed: </li>
<li><span style="text-decoration:underline">Provided</span> that the Court may, in its discretion, require such signature to be proved.”</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><u>Admission of Documents in Evidence &amp; Proof </u></strong></p>
<p>In <strong>Baldeo Sahai v. Ram Chander</strong>, AIR 1931 Lahore 546, it is held as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“There are <span style="text-decoration: underline">two stages relating to documents</span>. One is the stage when all the documents on which the parties rely are <span style="text-decoration: underline">filed by them in Court</span>. The next stage is when the documents <span style="text-decoration: underline">proved and formally tendered in evidence</span>. The word “proved” has been used by the Division Bench in the sense of ‘proposed to be proved’ as is clear from its having been used along with the word ‘tendered’ or “admitted” in evidence. The word proved has been loosely used for describing the stage after fling of the documents, when the Court would decide only whether they should be admitted or rejected. The Division Bench cannot be read as holding that the document is not to be endorsed with an Exhibit number unless and until proved. As stated hereinabove, the stages of<span style="text-decoration: underline"> tendering/admitting/rejecting in evidence and holding a document proved – are two distinct and different stages</span>, not one. They are respectively the second and third stages. <u>Admission <span style="text-decoration: underline">of a document in evidence is </span>not to be confused with proof of a document</u>.”</li>

How ever, by such admission of document, the <span style="text-decoration:underline">truth and correctness</span> of the contents by it self would not be established and <span style="text-decoration:underline">there must be some evidence</span> to support the contents of such document.</p>

<p style="line-height:1.5">Contents of the document cannot be proved by mere filing the document in a court.

<li>19. The question has been considered in depth by Justice Raman Nair (as he then was) in Sumathi Amma v. Kunjuleskhmi Amma (1964 Ker LT 945). The learned Judge observed (at pages 946 and 947) : “…  It (Section 67 Evidence Act) only says that facts have to be proved, and, unlike Section 68, does not prescribe any particular mode of proof.

<ul class="has-small-font-size wp-block-list">

The duties discharged by the registering officer do not include attestation or verification of attestation of will as required by the rules enacted by Section 63 of the Succession Act.

<li>Registration of a document does not dispense with the need of proving the execution and attestation of a document which is required by law to be proved in the manner as provided in Sec. 68 of the Evidence Act.

Pritam, 2013-3 HLR 1443, it is held by the Himachal Pradesh High Court that there was a <span style="text-decoration:underline">presumption of correctness</span> to the endorsement/ certificate issued by the Sub-Registrar at the time or registration of gift deed (Rewat Ram Sharma versus Munshi Ram, Latest HLJ 2002 (HP) 165) and that the onus to rebut the presumption on a registered deed was heavily on the plaintiff.</p>
<p><strong><u>Registered deed: Presumption – </u></strong>Validly Executed</p>
<p>It is held in Prem Singh v. Birbal, AIR 2006 SC 3608, as under:</p>
<ul class="has-small-font-size wp-block-list">
<li>“52. It is well-settled law that there is a presumption of a registered document being<span style="text-decoration:underline"> validly executed</span>. A registered document would, therefore, prima facie, be valid in law. The onus of proof, thus, would be on a person who questions the same.”</li>
</ul>
<p style="line-height:1.5">In Bellachi v. Pakeeran, AIR 2009 SC 3293, also it is a observed that a registered document carries with it a presumption that it was executed <span style="text-decoration:underline">in accordance with law</span>. The Apex Court observed in Jamila Begum v. Shami Mohd., AIR 2019 SC 72: 2018 KHC 7002 as under: </p>
<ul class="has-small-font-size wp-block-list">
<li>“A registered document carries with it a presumption that it was <span style="text-decoration:underline">validly executed</span>. It is for the party challenging the genuineness of the transaction to show that the transaction is not valid in law. In Prem Singh and others v. Birbel and others (2006) 5 SCC 353, it was held as under:
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“27. There is a<span style="text-decoration:underline"> presumption that a registered document is validly executed</span>. A registered document, therefore, prima facie would be valid in law. The onus of proof, thus, would be on a person who leads evidence to rebut the presumption. In the instant case, Respondent 1 has not been able to rebut the said presumption.”</li>

<p>The Kerala High Court held in Mariyadas v. Benjamin, ILR 2014-4 Ker 471, as under:</p>
<ul class="has-small-font-size wp-block-list">
<li>“If a Will has been registered, that is a circumstance which may, having regard to the circumstances, prove its <span style="text-decoration:underline">genuineness</span>. But the mere fact that a Will is registered Will it will not by itself be sufficient to dispel all suspicion regarding it where suspicion exists, without submitting the evidence of registration to a close examination. The bald fact of registration is insufficient, when there are other circumstances creating suspicion on the execution of the document.”</li>

<p>In Indore Development Authority v. Manoharlal, 2020-8 SCC 129, AIR  2020 SC 1496, it is observed:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“270. The decision in Velaxan Kumar (supra) cannot be said to be laying down the law correctly. The Court considered the photographs also to hold that the possession was not taken. <strong>Photographs cannot evidence as to whether possession was taken or not</strong>. Drawing of a Panchnama is an accepted mode of taking possession. Even after re-entry, a photograph can be taken; equally, it taken be taken after committing trespass. Such documents cannot prevail over the established mode of proving whether possession is taken, of lands. Photographs can be of little use, much less can they be a proof of possession. A person may re-enter for a short period or only to have photograph. That would not impinge adversely on the proceedings of taking possession by drawing Panchnama, which has been a rarely recognised and settled mode of taking possession.</li>
<li>271. In the decision in Raghbir Singh Sehrawat v. State of Haryana, (2012) 1 SCC 792 the observation made was that it is not possible to take the possession of entire land in a day on which the award was declared, cannot be accepted as laying down the law correctly and same is contrary to a large number of precedents. The decision in Narmada Bachao Andolan v. State of M.P. (2011) 7 SCC 639, is confined to particular facts of the case. The Commissioner was appointed to find out possession on the spot. DVDs and CDs were seen to hold that the landowners were in possession. The District Judge, Indore, recorded the statements of the tenure-holder. We do not approve the method of determining the possession by appointment of Commissioner or by DVDs and CDs as an acceptable mode of proving taking of possession. The drawing of Panchnama contemporaneously is sufficient and <strong>it is not open to a court Commissioner to determine the factum of possession within the purview of Order XXVII, Rule 9 CPC. </strong>Whether possession has been taken, or not, is not a matter that a court appointed Commissioner cannot opine. However, drawing of Panchnama by itself is enough and is  a proof of the fact that possession has been taken.”</li>
</ul>
<p>Kerala High Court held in Thomas VY@ Sajimon v. Joseph VY, ILR 2020-3 Ker446,  2020-3 Ker LJ  574, 2020-3 KHC 613, as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“15. In a suit for permanent prohibitory injunction, the burden is entirely on the plaintiff to bring convincing evidence to show his possession over the plaint schedule property and for so doing, it is not permissible for the plaintiff to invoke Order 26 Rule 9 CPC, which is intended for a different purpose. In a matter relating to the investigation into the disputed question of fact of <strong><u>possession</u></strong>, the power of appointment of Commissioner for local investigation cannot be exercised by the Court to assist the party to collect evidence, where the party can collect evidence by itself. If a party claims that, that party is in possession of the disputed property and if the other party denies the same by filing the written statement, the disputed fact can be adjudicated by the Court after framing of issues and recording the evidence of the parties. So many articles may be found in the building at the time of local inspection by the Commissioner. Even clothes and other articles may be found in the building. The Commissioner has to just make an inventory of the items found in the building. The Commissioner cannot report about the ownership of the articles found in the premises, as the said aspect is a matter for evidence. If at all the Commissioner makes any such report, the Court shall not accept the report, even for primary satisfaction without any other convincing material. If the Advocate Commission is deputed for the purpose of ascertaining the possession of the party over the property, the said aspect can be done only after gathering information from the people in the locality, which amounts to fishing out the evidence or gathering of evidence and hence the same is only hearsay information. The party can even otherwise examine the persons, with whom the Commissioner makes enquiry, before the Court to prove the possession of the person over the property in question. The fishing out of information is to make a local enquiry collecting hearsay materials from the persons gathered there or the like, which is different from collection of materials which he finds at the scene. That apart, if that task is left to be decided by the Advocate Commissioner, any fraudulent litigant can create evidence and with the assistance of the Commissioner, he will be able to prove that he is in possession of the property, which is not the purpose for which Order 26 was enacted. Therefore, it is always advisable not to appoint an Advocate Commissioner, as in the present case, to find out the possession of the property, which has to be decided only from oral and documentary evidence to be adduced by the parties. The High Court of Madras in Mr. D. Kuttiyappan v. Meenakshiammal Polytechnic Unit, (2005) 4 MLJ 592, held that the Advocate Commissioner cannot be appointed to note down the factum of possession or the enjoyment . I respectfully agree with the view of the High Court of Madras in D. Kuttiyappan (Supra). Thus, it is settled law that the power of appointment of Commissioner for local investigation cannot be exercised by the Court to enable any party to collect evidence through the Commissioner to prove the factum of possession or enjoyment. This being the situation, the argument of the learned Counsel for the defendant that the report of the Commissioner would show the possession of the defendant in the plaint schedule property cannot be accepted even for the prima facie satisfaction of the Court.”</li>
