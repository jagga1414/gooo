<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">Introspection</span></strong></p>
<p>Section 68 of the Evidence Act, 1872 mandates examination of one attesting witness at least to prove documents required by law to be attested (including Wills). When execution of a Will is ‘Admitted’ by the opposite side, should it be ‘Proved’?</p>
<p>There is difference of opinion.</p>
<p>Following latest decisions assuredly lay down that when execution of the will is ‘admitted’ by the opposite side, it <strong><u>need not be ‘proved’</u></strong> as required in Sec. 68 (by examining at least one witness).</p>

</ul>
<p>Following decisions laid down that even when execution of a will was ‘admitted’ by the opposite side, it <strong><u>must have been ‘proved’</u></strong> by examining at least one attesting witness.</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline">S.R. Srinivas v. S. Padmavathamma, (2010) 5 SCC 274</span> – It is observed – the execution of a Will can be held to have been proved only when the statutory requirements for proving the Will are satisfied. Admission in the pleadings as to the Will can only be about the “making of the Will” and not the “genuineness of the Will”.</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline">Vadakkayil Gopalan v. Vadakkayil Paru, (2013) 3 KerLT 69</span> –<strong> </strong>It is observed – proof of the Will by examining at least one witness was necessary (even if the Will has been admitted in the pleadings).</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline">Poulose A. V. v. Indira M.R., 2010 (3) KerLT Suppl. 185 : ILR 2010 Ker.388</span>  – It is observed – No distinction is drawn, by Sec. 68, between an admitted Will and a disputed Will in the mode of proof of execution; and therefore, in all cases in which the Will is set up the procedure prescribed in Sec. 68 will have to be followed.</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline">Ramesh Verma v. Lajesh Saxena (2017) 1 SCC 257</span> – It is observed – the mandate of Section 68 of the Evidence Act has to be followed even in a case where the opposite party does not specifically deny the execution of the document in the written statement.</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline">Sarada v. Radhamani, 2017 (2) KLT 327</span>. In this decision, rendered in a ‘Refence’ to resolve the dispute in the question we discuss, the Kerala High Court (DB) referred all the above decisions. And, declared the following decisions, as <strong>Per Incuriam</strong>
<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline">Princelal G. v. Prasannakumari, 2009 (3) KerLT Suppl. 134</span>2: ILR 2009 (3) Ker. 221<strong> </strong> – It is observed – where the execution of the Will is expressly admitted, neither Section 68 nor its proviso is attracted obliging the propounder of the Will to prove due execution of the Will (for, admitted facts need not be proved: Sec. 58 of the Evidence Act).</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline">Thayyullathil Kunhikannan v. Thayyullathil Kalliani, AIR 1990 Ker.226</span> – Relying on Order VIII Rule 5 C.P.C. and Sec. 58 of the Indian Evidence Act, it is held that when the execution of the Will is admitted, there will not be any requirement to prove the Will.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline">P. Malliga v. P. Kumaran, 2022 (2) LW 393</span>, (Followed in Ranga Pillai v. Mannar Pillai, 2022, Mad) – It is held by the Madras High Court that a Will shall not be used as evidence until it is proved in the manner prescribed under Section 68 of the Evidence Act. The judge did not agree the view in P. Radha v. Irudayadoss, 2022 SCCOnline Mad 886. (Note: This decision, P. Malliga v. P. Kumaran, is overruled in <strong>Boomathi v. Murugesan</strong>, 2023-2 Mad LJ 684, DB)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">S. 68 to be Followed, Even When the Opp. party does not Deny Execution</span></strong></p>
<p>Sec. 68 of the Evidence Act reads as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“68. <span style="text-decoration: underline">Proof of execution of document required by law to be attested</span>—If a document is required by law to be attested, it shall not be used as evidence until one attesting witness at least has been called for the purpose of proving its execution, if there be an attesting witness alive, and subject to the process of the Court and capable of giving evidence:</li>
<li>Provided that it shall not be necessary to call an attesting witness in proof of the execution of any document, <strong><em><u>not being a will</u></em></strong>, which has been registered in accordance with the provisions of the Indian Registration Act, 1908 (16 of 1908), unless its execution by the person by whom it purports to have been executed is specifically denied.</li>
</ul>
<p>In Ramesh Verma v. Rajesh Saxena, 2017-1 SCC 257, our Apex Court held as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“13. A will like any other document is to be proved in terms of the provisions of Sec. 68 of the Evidence Act and the Succession Act, 1925. The propounder of the will is called upon to show by satisfactory evidence that the will was signed by the testator, that the testator at the relevant time was in a sound and disposing state of mind, that he understood the nature and effect of the disposition and put his signature to the document on his own free will and the document shall not be used as evidence until one attesting witness at least has been called for the purpose of proving its execution. This is the mandate of Sec. 68 of the Evidence Act and the position remains the same even in a case where the opposite party does <strong>not specifically deny</strong> the execution of the document in the written statement.”</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">Contra View: </span><span style="text-decoration: underline">If ‘Admission’ (by the other side</span>),<span style="text-decoration: underline"> Need not Prove the Will</span></strong></p>
<p>It may be pointed out that the Apex Court did not consider in this decision, Ramesh Verma v. Rajesh Saxena – what is the position when the opposite party <strong>expressly admit</strong> the execution of the document.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline">Boomathi v. Murugesan, 2023-2 Mad LJ 684 (DB)</span></p>
<p>It is held in a recent Division Bench decision in <strong>Boomathi v. Murugesan</strong>, 2023-2 Mad LJ 684, that the position will be different if the Will is<strong> ‘categorically’ and ‘clearly’ <u>admitted</u></strong>. The Madras High Court referred Sec. 17 (Admission) and Sec. 58 (Facts admitted need not be proved) and came to the conclusion , Sec. 68 will not be attracted where the Will is “<strong>admitted</strong>” by the other side. The Division Bench held as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“23. First and foremost, it is to be borne in mind that before the Hon’ble Supreme Court in Jagdish Chand Sharma Vs. Narain Singh Saini [Dead] through Legal Representatives and Others, reported in 2015 [8] SCC 615, the validity of the Will was a core issue and the Hon’ble Supreme Court  proceeded to discuss the law with regard to proof of a Will in accordance with the statute. In such context, the Hon’ble Supreme Court has held that the position with regard to proof of a Will remains the same even if the opposite party does not specifically deny execution of the same.</li>
<li>24. The above judgment has been followed by learned Single Judges of this Court in  P. Malliga Vs. P. Kumaran reported in 2022 [2] LW 393 and Akkinirajan Vs. Maheswari and Others reported in 2023 [1] LW 72.</li>
<li>25. This Court draws the distinction between <strong>‘specifically denied’, ‘not specifically denied’</strong> and ‘<strong>admitted</strong>‘. The first two instances, namely, ‘specifically denied’ and ‘not specifically denied’, would fall within one category. Insofar as proof of a Will in both cases in this category, the Will would have to be necessarily proved by the propounder. However, where the opposite party <strong><em><u>categorically admits</u></em></strong> to the Will, the position would be certainly different. In India, we follow what is called the system ‘adversarial proceedings’, which is also followed in the British Courts. The foundation of this School is that parties before a Court would have to deal with facts in issue namely facts that are asserted and denied by the parties to the lis and the Court would proceed to adjudicate on such issues. When there is no dispute between the parties on certain matters, the Court would not venture to require proof of such admitted facts.”</li>
<li>“33. This Court has applied its mind to the various principles laid down by the Hon’ble  Supreme Court as well as this Court and other High Courts, especially in the context of Sec. 68 of the Indian Evidence Act, proof of a Will where execution is not specifically denied and in cases where the execution is <strong><u>categorically admitted.</u></strong> The ratio laid down by the Hon’ble Supreme Court in Ramesh Verma’s case [cited supra] reported in 2017 [1] SCC 257, cannot be a precedent for the proposition where the opposite <u>party </u><strong><u>clearly admits</u></strong> to the execution of the subject Will as in the instant case. Therefore, we are <span style="text-decoration: underline">not in respectful agreement</span> with the judgments in P. Malliga’s case<strong> </strong>(<span style="text-decoration: underline">P. Malliga v. P. Kumaran</span>, 2022 (2) LW 393) and<strong> </strong>Akkinirajan’s case (<span style="text-decoration: underline">Akkinirajan Vs. Maheswari,</span> 2023 [1] LW 72) following the ratio laid down by the Hon’ble Supreme Court in Jagdish Chand Sharma’s case. On the contrary, we approve the ratio laid down in <strong>P. Radha Vs. Irudayadoss</strong> and Others reported in 2022 SCC Online Mad 886 and Vanjiammal and Others Vs. Vidya and Others in the order dtd. 21/4/2017 made in CRP.[PD] No.3659/2013.”</li>
</ul>
<p>The same view is taken in <strong>Rajeev Gupta v. Prashant Garg, 2022-1 All LJ 435</strong>. The court held as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“The <strong><u>admission</u></strong> were in the pleadings of the parties and therefore there was no requirement of proving the will in the present suit. Admittedly, the defendant Nos. 2 to 4/appellants have claimed their title through Ramesh Chand Garg who never disputed the validity of the will rather in the Original Suit No. 458 of 1992, he admitted its validity and therefore, the lower appellate court has rightly decreed the suit and held that the will was neither required to be proved in the present suit nor the filing of original will was necessary.”</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><u>Do General Provisions of S. 58 give way to Special Provisions of S. 68</u></strong></p>
<p>Three views are possible:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>First: Requirement of <strong>calling at lest one witness</strong> to prove those documents that requires attestation, in spite of express admission from the opposite party as to the execution of the document in the written statement.</li>
<li>Second: If the Will is <strong>(even impliedly) admitted</strong>, Sec. 68 need not be invoked.</li>
<li>Third: If only the Will is <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">expressly</span> or categorically admitted</strong>, then only there will be alleviation of burden laid down in Sec. 68.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the light of the Apex Court decision in Ramesh Verma v. Rajesh Saxena, 2017-1 SCC 257, <sub>(that the position – as to proof of documents requires attestation – remains the same even in a case where the opposite party does <strong>not specifically deny</strong> the execution of the document in the written statement)</sub> it appears that the second view stated above (taken in Thayyullathil Kunhikannan v. Thayyullathil Kalliani, AIR 1990 Ker 226) is not sustainable.</p>
<p>But, the proposition of law in the third view above, applied in <strong>Boomathi v. Murugesan</strong> (supra), and other decisions <sub>(that the position – as to proof of documents requires attestation – will be different if the Will is <strong>“categorically <u>admitted</u>“</strong>),</sub> sounds good.</p>
<p><strong><u>Authoritative Judicial Pronouncement is yet to be Arrived</u></strong></p>
<p>It is also pertinent to note that the Kerala High Court, in <strong>Sarada v. Radhamani</strong> (supra), pointed out that the general provisions of Sect. 58 of the Evidence Act has ‘to give way to the special provisions’ of Sec. 68 of the Act; and it was remarked that there was no distinction between an ‘admitted Will’ and a ‘disputed Will’ as to the mode of proof.</p>
<p>It appears that the placing the doctrine of <em><u>‘specific provisions override general provisions</u></em>‘ is rational; for, the following words in Sec. 68 places a ‘non-obstante clause’ –</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“it shall <strong><u>not be used as evidence</u></strong> until one attesting witness at least has been called for the purpose of proving its execution”.</li>
</ul>
<p>However, it will also be a forceful argument if one says that a section in the Evidence Act cannot be protected from certain fundamental principles of the Evidence Act which include ‘best evidence rule’, ‘admitted facts need not be proved’ etc., unless strong persuasive indications are laid down in the provision concerned. (It is also noteworthy that Sec. 68 does not proceed with a non-obstante clause.) In any event, the scheme of the Evidence Act shows that Chapter III (the beginning Chapter of Part II) which deals with “Facts Need Not be Proved”, is meant to govern the succeeding chapters including the Chapter V that deals with ‘Documentary Evidence’ wherein Sec. 68 is included.</p>
<p>It is also significant – Sec. 58 says that ‘Admitted facts need not be <strong><u>proved</u></strong>’; and Sec. 68 speaks as to “<strong><u>Proof</u></strong> of execution of document required by law to be attested” and that the attesting witness is called “for the purpose of <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">proving</span></strong> its execution”. That is, the question of ‘proof’ under Sec. 68 does not arise if ‘execution of document’ has already been admitted by the other side.</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Note: Proviso to Sec. 58 enables the court to require proof, despite the admission of the other side, if it finds proper. Proviso to Sec. 58 reads as under:</li>
<li>“Provided that the Court may, in its discretion, require the facts admitted to be proved otherwise than by such admissions.”</li>
</ul>
<p>Therefore, an authoritative judicial pronouncement is yet to be arrived, taking note of various potential contentions in this regard.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">Conclusion</span></strong></p>
<p>Following documents are required by law to be attested by attesting witnesses.</p>
<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li>Will: Sec. 63 of the Succession Act.</li>
<li>Mortgage deed: Sec. 59 of the T P Act.</li>
<li>Gift deed: Sec. 123 of the T P Act.</li>
<li>Bond: Sec.  2(5) of the Indian Stamp Act, 1899.</li>
</ol>
<p>Section 68 of the Evidence Act, 1872 mandates examination of one attesting witness at least to prove the aforesaid four documents required by law to be attested. The proviso to Sec. 68 lays down the following: if the aforesaid documents, <em><u>EXCEPT WILL</u>,</em> are (i) registered in accordance with the provisions of Indian Registration Act, 1908 and (ii) not specifically denied by the person who executed it, execution of those documents need not necessarily be proved by calling ‘an attesting witness’. That is, for the purpose of proving the Will (alone), the examination of ‘an attesting witness’ is necessary. It is difficult to support the logic and grounds for picking out Will (in Sec. 68 Evidence Act), from other (three) documents that are required by law to be attested by attesting witnesses. </p>
<p>But, note – the Will stands picked out (in Sec. 68 Evidence Act) from other (three) documents that are required by law to be attested by attesting witnesses. </p>
