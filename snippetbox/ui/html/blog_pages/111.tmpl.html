</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">Does the Plantation Exemption confer Unconditional Rights over the ‘LAND’?</span></strong></p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>It is for the following reasons –</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>1. The exemption is to the ‘<strong>plantation</strong>‘, and not to the ‘<strong>land</strong>‘.</li>
<li>2. Exemption continues (only) as long as the plantation exists or continues;</li>

<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>S. 2.(44) defines ‘plantation’ as land used principally for the cultivation of a specific ‘plantation crop‘ like tea, coffee, cocoa, rubber etc.</li>
<li>Section 87, Explanation II states that if a plantation for which exemption is given on recognition of a specific ‘plantation-crop’ is <strong><u>converted into</u> </strong>any other ‘plantation-crop’ or the plantation activity is not continued, the exemption may be lost; and the land will be taken for considering the ceiling limit.</li>

<li>Such tenants also get benefit of exemption under Sec. 81 and they can continue without being affected by the ceiling limit under Sec. 82 and 83.</li>

<p><strong><u>Effect of Conversion of A Portion of Exempted Land</u></strong> <strong><u>into a Non-exempted Category</u></strong></p>
<p>Section 87 reads as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“S.87. Excess land obtained by gift, etc. to be surrendered – (1) Where any person acquires any land dafter the date notified under Section 83 by gift, purchase, mortgage with possession, lease, surrender or any other kind of transfer inter vivos or by bequest or inheritance or otherwise and in consequence thereof the total <span style="text-decoration: underline">extent of land owned or held by such person exceeds the ceiling area</span>, such excess shall be surrendered to such authority as may be prescribed.</li>
<li>       Explanation 1 – Where any land is exempted by or under Section 81 and such exemption is in force on the date notified under Section 83, such land shall, with effect from the date on which it ceases to be exempted, be deemed to be land acquired after the date notified under Section 83.</li>
<li>       Explanation II – Where, after the date notified under Section 83, any class of land specified in Schedule II has been <strong><u>converted into any other class of land</u></strong> specified in that Schedule or any land exempt under Section 81 from the provisions of this Chapter is converted into any class of land not so exempt and <span style="text-decoration: underline">in consequence thereof the total extent of land owned or held by a person exceeds the ceiling area</span>, so much extent of land as is in excess of the ceiling area, shall be deemed to be land acquired after the said date.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><u>No Total Prohibition in using Exempted Land for a Different Purpose</u></strong></p>
<p>Explanation II does not make a total bar. It only causes to lose benefit of the exemption to a certain extent. That is, if a person converts any portion of his exempted land to any other class, that converted extent will be added to his account in determining his ceiling limit; and the Taluk Land Board can proceed upon that (excess) land. In short, the exemption will be lost for that portion. In this premises, in Wayanad Granites v. District Collector, 2023-4 KLT 874, it is held that ‘fragmentation is per se not illegal’. similarly, in District Collector v. Sajith Lal, 2023-4 KLJ 851, it is held that ‘there is no embargo under law in using any exempted land for non-exempted purposes as well’.</p>
<p>In <strong>Mathew K.T v. State of Kerala, 19 April, 2024</strong>, in the light of earlier decisions, observed that there is no total prohibition in using an exempted land for a different purpose under the Kerala Land Reforms Act. The impediment or restriction is (only) the following –</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">

<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“We however add that any class of land earlier exempted in the ceiling case can be converted into any class of land not liable to be exempted under Explanation II to Section 87 of the Act.

<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“9. On promulgation of the KLR Act in the State, the entire landed property in the State is subjected to State control as envisaged under the provisions of the KLR Act. No piece of the land escapes the clutches of the KLR Act including exempted land for ceiling purposes. The ceiling proceedings is a continuing proceedings and can be reopened in any of the circumstances, if so warranted, as contemplated under Section 87 of the KLR Act. Exemption granted from ceiling is the qualification to use the land in a particular manner, which means a burden is imposed on the land. The moment the qualification for exemption is vanished by conversion of the land, the protection from ceiling will also be extinguished to bring the land within the fold of the ceiling area. The <span style="text-decoration: underline">exemption is in the nature of a burden on the land</span> to use the land <span style="text-decoration: underline">for the purpose for which exemption is granted</span>. The eminent domain power of the State can be exercised for acquiring land without consent and also to regulate the use of land in public interest.

The Division Bench of this Court in the <span style="text-decoration: underline">State Human Rights Protection Centre, Thrissur and another v.

<p><strong><u>Effect of Fragmentation for Non-exempted Category</u></strong></p>
<p>The decision in One Earth One Life v.

When the matter was placed before the Taluk Land Board under Sec 87, KLR Act, it found that there was no change in classification of the land and therefore dropped the proceedings. The Court held as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“34. Section 81 of the KLR Act is in pith and substance a special provision, with its main objective of giving exemption to certain lands including the lands maintained as plantations is to prevent fragmentation of the land and to keep it as plantation itself to improve the economy of the state for welfare of people as a whole while the Act creates a regime, the State is under an obligation to safeguard, the intended purpose of the provisions of the Act in its spirit. ….. …… It could be gathered from the records that the proposal to transfer 1.03 acres of land to each workers in discharge of their service or retrenchment benefits will definitely divide the plantation into separate slots and that would definitely change the character/nature of the plantation, which could be termed as ‘conversion’ and that will be against the provisions of the Act.”</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><u>Can a Tenant of Plantation Transfer his Rights, Fragmenting the Plantation</u></strong></p>
<p>Possession is a heritable and transferable right. [See: Nallammal Vs. Ayisha Beevi, 2017-5 Mad LJ 864; Phirayalal Kapur Vs. Jia Rani, AIR 1973 Delhi 186]. Therefore, a tenant of plantation having rights of fixity (Sec. 13) may have the right to transfer it to another. In any case, the change of character or nature of the plantation by fragmentation being amount to ‘conversion’ that will be against the provisions of the Act, as pointed out in One Earth One Life v. State of Kerala, 2019-2 KHC(SN) 10; 2019-1 KLT 985.</p>
<p><strong><u>PART – IV </u></strong><strong></strong></p>
<p><strong><u>VESTING OF LAND IN GOVT. &amp; RIGHT OF GOVT. TO COLLECT RENT</u></strong><strong></strong></p>
<p>According to the provisions of the KLR Act, lands held by individuals (or associations of persons) vest in Govt. under two provisions. They are-</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>First, Sec. 72 – Vesting of landlord’s rights in Government.</li>
<li>Second, 86. Vesting of excess lands in Government.
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Note: Sec. 86 does not apply to Plantations, for (i) they being already vest in Govt. under Sec. 72, and (ii) if Govt. land, no question of vesting arises.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Section 72(1) reads:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“72. <strong>Vesting </strong>of landlord’s rights<strong> in Government</strong>: (1) On a date to be notified by the Government in this behalf in the Gazette, all right, title and interest of the landowners and intermediaries in respect of holdings held by <strong>cultivating tenants</strong> (including holders of kudiyirippus and holders karaimas) entitled to fixity of tenure under Section 13, and in respect of which certificates of purchase under Sub-section (2) of Section 59 have not been issued, shall, subject to the provisions of this section, vest in the government free from all encumbrances created by the landowners and intermediaries and subsisting thereon the said date”</li>

<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“Provided that the exemption under this clause shall not apply to lands owned by the Government of Kerala and held by any person under lease“.</li>
</ul>
<p>This proviso is introduced in 1971. By virtue of this amendment (introducing Section 81(1)(a) Proviso) “Plantation-Exemption” takes effect on Government-lease-land (with tenants).</p>
<p>But it must be noted that a ‘valid lease’ must exist. That is, the person in possession of government land should be a “lessee”; he must not be trespasser or a person who forfeit the title of Government.</p>
<p>Section 81(1)(a) Proviso reads as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“Provided that the exemption under this clause shall not apply to lands owned by the Government of Kerala and held by any person under lease whether current or time expired or otherwise.”</li>
</ul>
<p>The word “otherwise” must be understood as a permissive occupation</p>
<p>In MT Joseph v.  State of Kerala, AIR 1974 Ker 28, it is held-</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“Clause (a) of Sub-section (1) of Section 81 by which “Government lands held under a lease current or time expired or otherwise” can be understood only as referring to such lands which are held by persons in permissive possession. The word “otherwise” must be understood as a permissive occupation otherwise than under a lease. The word “otherwise” has no wider meaning in the context. So understood, the exemption to Clause (a) of that Section is perfectly legal and in that limited sense we uphold that provision as valid.”</li>
</ul>
<p>Tenant is defined in Sec 2 (57) as under:</p>

<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>But, <strong><em>Sec. 112</em></strong> of the KLR Act says as to ‘Apportionment of land value in cases of acquisition’.</li>
<li>Because of the “<strong>Legal Right conferred by Statute</strong>“ upon the former tenants of the plantation, they are entitled for certain compensation, when that land is required for the Govt..</li>
<li>In cases falling under Chapter II (pertaining to, tenants entitled for fixity, issuance of purchase certificate etc.) Section 72 deals with the right, title and interest of the land owners and intermediaries in respect of the holdings held by the cultivating tenants; and says -the land will be free from encumbrances created by the land-owners and intermediaries.</li>
<li>However, insofar as the cultivating tenant is concerned, an absolute right is vested with him to seek assignment (within ceiling limit) subject to the payment of purchase price – as stated in Section 72D. (See: Glen Leven Estate (P) Ltd. v. State of Kerala, 2022-6 Ker LT 439.)</li>
<li>No ‘authority’ is also named in any law to fix the compensation to be given to the former tenants, when the Govt. requires it.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Therefore, it is said – Apportionment of land value in cases of ‘acquisition’.
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Note:  It makes no difference (<strong>SUBSTANTIALLY, IN DETERMINING COMPENSATION)</strong> whether such a plantation land is “acquired” or not.

<p><strong><u>Glen Leven Estate (P) Ltd. v. State of Kerala, 2022-6 Ker LT 439</u></strong></p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>In Glen Leven Estate (P) Ltd. v. State of Kerala, 2022-6 Ker LT 439, the question as to ‘rival claims raised by the cultivating tenant and landlord for compensation on acquisition’ arose. The land was leased out by landlords. The lease-rights came in the cultivating tenants by transfer. The Government contended that the tenant was a cultivating tenant and the land vested upon the Govt. under Sec. 72 KLR Act. Hence tenant alone would be entitled to get compensation for the improvements to be determined under the Kerala Compensation for Tenants Improvements Act, 1958, in view of Section 20(1) of the KLR Act.</li>
<li>The landlords argued that the land was a plantation (over 30 acres) when it was (originally) leased, and therefore, they are entitled to claim exemption and benefits in the light of the exemption under clause (viii)  of Section 3 (1) of the KLR Act. Since there would be no fixity of tenure, it being a plantation, there would not be vesting of rights of the land owner in the Government. Hence, there should be the apportionment of the compensation between the lessor and the lessee and it should be decided in the acquisition proceedings.</li>
<li>The single Judge dismissed the writ petition, ‘leaving open the liberty of the lessee as well as the landlords, to approach the civil court seeking relief against the Government, and also to resolve the inter se dispute by and between the tenant and the landlords’.</li>
<li>The Division Bench, in appeal held that ‘land acquisition’ proceedings are to be initiated. It is pointed out that (even if it is a land vested in Govt.) there is no provision in Sec. 72 for ‘resuming’ if and when Govt. need it. The court also observed as under –

On an analysis of the provisions of Section 72(1) of the Act, 1963, it is clear that when the Government notified the said provision with effect from 01.01.1970, all right, title and interest of the landowners and intermediaries in respect of holdings held by cultivating tenants (including holders of kudiyirippus and holders karaimas) entitled to fixity of tenure under Section 13, and in respect of which certificates of purchase under sub-Section (2) of Section 59 have not been issued, vested in the Government.</li>
<li>32. Therefore, it is clear from Section 72 that what is vested with the Government is the right, title and interest of the land owners and intermediaries in respect of the holdings held by the cultivating tenants. It is nothing but a legal fiction by which the interest held by a cultivating tenant in a property of a landlord or intermediary is protected from 01.01.1970 .</li>
<li>34. On a conjoint reading of Sections 72 and 72A, it can be seen that vesting of rights in the Government contained under Section 72 is the rights held by the landlord and the intermediary in respect of holdings held by the cultivating tenants. However, the same will not, in any manner, interfere with the rights enjoyed by a cultivating tenant in contemplation of the provisions of the Act, 1963.”</li>
<li>42. Therefore, we have no doubt in our mind to hold that Section 72 of Act, 1963 would only deal with the right, title and interest of the land owners and intermediaries in respect of the holdings held by the cultivating tenants free from encumbrances created by the land owners and intermediaries. However, the legal provisions discussed above would make it clear that insofar as the cultivating tenant is concerned, an absolute right is vested with him to seek assignment subject to the payment of purchase price in contemplation of Section 72D of the Act, 1963.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>While considering the right of landlord, it is pointed out (basing on the principle, or scheme of the KLR Act<strong>*<sup>*</sup></strong>) that the landlord may have right for compensation under Section 72BB. The Division Bench said-
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“36. So also, sub-Section (1) of Section 72BB dealing with ‘the right of landlord to apply for assignment and compensation’ specifies that any landowner or intermediary, whose right, title and interest in respect of any holding have vested in the Government, may apply to the Land Tribunal for the assignment of such right, title and interest to the cultivating tenant and for the payment of the compensation due to him under Section 72A.”</li>

<ul class="wp-block-list">

</ul>
</li>
<li><strong><sup>3. The <u>landlords of such plantation will get the benefits</u> (under Sec. 81) and protection from ceiling limit that is stipulated under the provisions of Sec. 82, 83 etc. (that is, there will be no ceiling limit).</sup></strong></li>
<li><strong><sup>4. In such a case, the right of landlord may be on a higher level or footing than the tenant (to get compensation).</sup></strong></li>

<p><strong><u>The Govt. is Entitled Reasonable ‘Rent</u></strong>’<strong><u> and Land Tax</u></strong></p>
<p>The land being vest in Govt., it <strong>can collect </strong>reasonable<strong><u> ‘rent’</u></strong>. Sec. 72E reads as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>72E. <u>Rent of holdings vested in Government but not assigned to cultivating tenants.</u></strong> – Where in respect of any holding or part thereof, the right, title and interest of the landowner and intermediaries have vested in the Government under Section 72 and the cultivating tenant is not entitled to the assignment of such right, title and interest by virtue of Sub-section (1) of Section 72, the cultivating tenant <strong><u>shall be</u></strong> liable to pay to the Government the rent payable under this Act from the date of vesting under Section 72.</li>

<li>(2) In the case of a holding or part of a holding in respect of which an application for resumption under the provisions of this Act is rejected, the cultivating tenant shall be liable to pay the basic tax and other taxes and cesses in respect of such holding or part of the holding, as the case may be, with effect on and from the date notified under Sub-section (1) of Section 72.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><u>PART – V</u></strong> — <strong>Civil Court Jurisdiction : Decisions</strong></p>
<p><strong><u>Supreme Court Decision – Plantation put up by tenant on land leased.</u></strong></p>
<p>The Supreme Court held in <strong>Rt. Rev. Jerome Fernandez vs. Be Be Rubber Estate</strong>, 1972 KLT 613.  It is observed as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“It may well be that the legislature thought that it will not be fair or proper to deny the benefit of fixity of tenure to lessees who might have taken on lease extensive parambas or waste land and might have in course of time by their hard toil developed them into plantations.”</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><u>When</u></strong> <strong>Civil Court can Interfere</strong></p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Even when a tribunal is provided for redressal of remedies, the civil courts will have jurisdiction to examine the allegation of non-compliance of the provisions of the statute or of any of the fundamental principles of judicial procedure. If the challenge is only as to the ‘erroneous’ character of the order, other than ‘jurisdictional error’, the suit will not be maintainable. (South Delhi Municipal Corporation v. Today Homes and Infrastructure Pvt.  Ltd.  2019-4 CivCC 150 (SC); 2019-3 CurCC 370(SC); 2019-11 Scale 33).</li>
<li>When an order is passed by a statutory Land-Tribunal violating a mandatory provision, the order will be illegal, without jurisdiction and a nullity. The civil courts which are courts of “general jurisdiction” can decide whether a tribunal or authority exercising statutory jurisdiction has acted in excess or beyond the statutory powers. The civil courts can interfere when the order of the statutory tribunal or authority is really not an order under the Act conferring jurisdiction on it. In other words, if a tribunal abuses its power or does not act under the Act but in violation of its provisions (Firm Seth Radha Kishan v. Ludhiana Municipality AIR 1963 SC 1547), the jurisdiction of the civil court will not be excluded. The ultimate decision can be challenged, in spite of finality and exclusionary clauses (or provision for appeal/revision), since the jurisdiction had been assumed by the tribunal, where it did not exist, and the decision was not a decision under the Act, but a nullity. <strong>(Muhammad Haji v. Kunhunni Nair, AIR  1993 Ker 104</strong>).</li>

In other words, the statute prescribes liability on the person who owes or hold the land in excess of the ceiling limit and if such a person fails to file the statement in accordance with law, the Board is enjoined to proceed against such person.”</li>

<p><strong><u>Whether Private Land or Government Land – Outside jurisdiction of TLB</u></strong></p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>The Kerala High Court, in Jagadeesachandran Nair Vs. Mamomohanan Pandarathil, 2013 (4) KLT 584, refused to call for the TLB proceedings in the Writ Petition filed by the State of Kerala before the High Court for calling for the records of the Taluk Land Board constituted under the Kerala Land Reforms Act to quash certain proceedings, claiming that the large extent of land held by the respondent was liable to be forfeited under the Kerala Escheats and Forfeitures Act, 1950. The State contended that there was gross violation of the land laws and FERA. The State also asserted a fraud on the Constitution of India, warranting immediate action in public interest and based on public policy as enjoined under Article 296 of the Constitution.</li>
<li>Analysing this decision it is pointed out in Harrisons Malayalam Ltd, v. State of Kerala, 2018 (2) Ker LT 369, that in Jagadeesachandran’s case it was noticed that the question whether the land was a private land or a government land was totally outside the scope of the proceedings pending before the TLB.</li>

<p><strong><u>Is the Tenant of a Plantation a <em>“</em>Cultivating Tenant<em>”</em>?</u></strong></p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Yes</strong>.</li>
<li>Sec. 2(8) defines cultivating tenant as under:</li>
<li><em>“</em>Cultivating tenant<em>“</em> means a tenant who is in actual possession of, and is entitled to cultivate, the land comprised in his holding.”</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><u>Can Purchase-Certificate be given to Plantation-Land, over &amp; above Ceiling-Limit</u></strong>?</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>No</strong>.</li>
<li>Because, under Sec. <strong>72B(2)</strong> a cultivating tenant is <strong><u>entitled</u></strong> to get assigned the area within the ceiling limit under Sec. <strong>82</strong> alone.</li>
</ul>
<p>Sec. 72B reads as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“72B. Cultivating tenants right to assignment. – (1) The cultivating tenant of any holding or part of a holding, the right, title and interest in respect of which have vested in the Government under Section 72, shall be <strong><u>entitled </u></strong>to assignment of such right, title and interest:</li>
<li>Provided that</li>
<li>(a) no cultivating tenant shall be <strong>entitled</strong> to assignment of the right, title and interest in respect of any holding or part of a holding under this Section if he, or if he is a member of a family, such family, owns an extent of land not less than-the ceiling area.</li>
<li>(b) where the cultivating tenant or, if he is a member of a family, such family, does not own any land or owns an extent of land which is less than the ceiling area, he shall be <strong>entitled</strong> to the assignment of the right, title and interest in respect of only such extent of land as will, together with the land, if any, owned by him or his family, as the case may be, be equal to the ceiling area.</li>
<li><em>Explanation.</em> – In calculating the extent of land owned by the cultivating tenant or, where he is a member of a family, by such family, for the purposes of clauses (a) and (b) of the foregoing proviso, the portion of the land owned by such cultivating tenant or by the family, which is liable to be assigned to the cultivating tenants holding under him or such family, shall not be taken into account.</li>
<li>(2) The provisions of Section 82 shall, so far as may be, apply to the calculation of the ceiling area for the purposes of the proviso to Sub-section (1);</li>
<li>Provided that if no date has been notified under Section 83, the date notified under Section 72 shall be deemed to be the date notified under Section 83.</li>
<li>(3) Any cultivating tenant <strong>entitled </strong>to assignment of the right, title and interest in respect of a holding or part of a holding under Sub-section (1) may apply to the Land Tribunal within whose jurisdiction such holding or part is situate within two years from the dote of vesting of such right, title and interest in the Government under Section 72, or such further time as may be allowed by the Government in this behalf, for such assignment to him.</li>
<li>(4) An application under Sub-section (3) shall contain the following particulars, namely:</li>
<li>(a) the village, survey number and extent of the holding or part to which the assignment relates.</li>
<li>(b) the name and address of the landowner and intermediaries and also of every other person interested in the land and the nature of their interest so far as they arc known to him;</li>
<li>(c) the particulars regarding the other lands owned or held by him or if he is a member of a family; by such family; and</li>
<li>(d) such other particulars as may be prescribed.</li>
<li>(5) Where a cultivating tenant is <strong>entitled </strong>to the assignment of the right, title and interest in respect of only a portion of the holding held by him, he may indicate in the application under Sub-section (3) his choice of the portion to which the assignment shall relate.”</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><u>Balanoor Case – Cultivating Tenant ‘Entitled to Assignment’, were Obliged to Apply</u></strong></p>
<p>Balanoor Plantations &amp; Industries Ltd. v. State of Kerala, 2018(3) KLT 283, it was observed that a cultivating tenant, “<strong><u>entitled to assignment</u></strong>” of the right under Sec. 72B, if failed to apply the same, will not have ‘vested right to continue’, as a cultivating tenant and he will not be entitled to the benefit of fixity under Sec. 13 of the KLR Act.</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Note: The tenant who opts to avail benefits of plantation-exemption, under Sec. 81, cannot seek fragmentation (Sec. 87, Explanation II) of the plantation land so as to obtain purchase-certificate (under Sec. 72A, 72B or 72C) within ceiling limit. (Note: No rider to Sec. 72B and 72C, by way of proviso or otherwise, exempting plantation.) Still, he stands as a cultivating tenant, “<strong><u>entitled to assignment</u></strong>” of the right under Sec. 72B. As shown elsewhere, there is an option for the tenant – either to obtain purchase-certificate or to avail plantation-exemption.</li>
</ul>
<p>Sec. 72B provides for cultivating tenant’s rights to get assignment by purchase certificate (through LT) – <strong><u>within ceiling area</u></strong>. Tenant is “obliged to apply” for it within 2 years from 1-1-1970. Therefore, the cultivating tenants entitled to assignment of the right, title and interest were “<strong><u>obliged to apply</u></strong>” to the Land Tribunal within the time fixed for asserting the claim as cultivating tenants. This decision also says that tenants having ‘no bona fide claim’ as to cultivating-tenancy will not have the benefit of fixity under Sec. 13 of the KLR Act, and they will have ‘no vested right to continue’.</p>
<p>Sec. 73B(3) reads as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“(3) Any cultivating tenant entitled to assignment of the right, title and interest in respect of a holding or part of a holding under Sub­section (1) may apply to the Land Tribunal within whose jurisdiction such holding or part is situate within two years from the date of vesting of such right, title and interest in the Government under Section 72, or such further time as may be allowed by the Government in this behalf, for such assignment to him.”</li>
