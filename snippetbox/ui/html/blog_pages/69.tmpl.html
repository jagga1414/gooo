<p><strong><u>Introduction</u></strong>.</p>
<p>The legal principles, ‘Possession Follows Title’ and ‘Title Follows Possession’, are  Rules of Evidence. (<mark class="has-inline-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#230df9">In grammar – ‘B follows A’ means ‘A comes before B’ or ‘A is followed by B’</mark>.) They are applied in cases where there are no sufficient and independent evidence to prove possession or title, as the case may be. </p>
<p>Under S. 110 Evidence Act, ownership is presumed on the proof of possession. It ‘follows from well settled principle of law that normally, unless contrary is established, title always follows possession'(Chuharmal v.  Commissioner of Income Tax, M P, AIR  1988 SC 1384; 1988 3 SCC 588<strong>).</strong></p>
<p>S. 114 Evidence Act, expressly permits the court to ‘presume the existence of any fact which it thinks likely to have happened, regard being had to the common course of natural events, human conduct and public and private business, in their relation to the facts of the particular case’. Therefore, by virtue of Sec. 114, </p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>(i) possession can be presumed on the basis of title (possession follows title), and </li>
<li>(ii) title/ownership can be presumed on the basis of possession (title follows possession).</li>

<p><strong><u>S. 110 Evidence Act</u></strong> <strong><u>&amp; the Principle, ‘Title Follows Possession’</u></strong></p>
<p>Section 110 of the Evidence Act, 1872, reads as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“110. <span style="text-decoration:underline">Burden of proof as to ownership</span>.—When the question is whether any person is owner of anything of which he is shown to be in possession, the burden of proving that he is not the owner is on the person who affirms that he is not the owner.”</li>
</ul>
<p>This section deals with the burden of proof as to ownership – <span style="text-decoration:underline">when a</span> <span style="text-decoration:underline">question arises as to whether a person in possession of anything is the owner</span> of such thing. There, the burden of proving that he is not the owner is on the person who avers that he is not the owner. </p>
<p>In State of A.P. v. Star Bone Mill &amp; Fertiliser Company, (2013) 9 SCC 319,<strong> </strong>the Apex Court held that the object of Section 110 is based on public policy. The object is to prevent persons from committing a breach of peace by taking the law into their own hands however good their title may be over the land in question. This object underlies provisions such as Section 6 of the Specific Relief Act 1963, Section 145 of the Code of Criminal Procedure 1973 and Sections 154 and 158 of the Indian Penal Code 1860.</p>
<p>In <strong>M.  Siddiq   v. Mahant Suresh Das (Ayodhya Case), 2020-1 SCC 1</strong>, it is observed as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li> “<strong>784.</strong> Section 110 deals with the burden of proof – Where the provision applies, the burden of proving that another person who is in possession is not the owner lies on the person who affirms against the ownership of that other person. But, for Section 110 to be attracted, there must be a question as to whether any person is the owner of anything and the ownership claimed must be that of which he is shown to be in possession. <span style="text-decoration:underline">Section 110</span> is based on the principle that <span style="text-decoration:underline">title follows possession</span>. That is why the provision postulates that where a person is shown to be in possession, and <span style="text-decoration:underline">a question arises as to whether that person is the owner</span>, the law casts the <span style="text-decoration:underline">burden of disproving</span> ownership on the individual <span style="text-decoration:underline">who affirms that the person in possession is not the owner</span>.”</li>
<li><strong>“785.</strong> Several decisions of this Court have interpreted the provisions of Section 110. <span style="text-decoration:underline">Section 110 is based on the principle</span> that <span style="text-decoration:underline">possession in and of itself may raise a presumption of title</span>. But <strong><span style="text-decoration:underline">this</span> <span style="text-decoration:underline">applies when the facts disclose no title in either of the disputants</span></strong> in which case, as it is said, possession alone decides. Hence, on the other hand, it is also well-settled that the<span style="text-decoration:underline"> presumption cannot be arise when the facts are known.”</span></li>
</ul>
<p>The Apex Court, in M.  Siddiq   v. Mahant Suresh Das, relied on Nair Service Society v. Fr. KC Alexander, AIR 1968 SC 1165<strong>, </strong>wherein it was observed that when no title in either of the disputants, ‘possession alone decides’.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration:underline">‘Possession is good against all but the True Owner’</span><span style="text-decoration:underline"> &amp; Sec. 6 of the Sp. Relief Act</span></strong></p>
<p>The principle ‘Possession is Good against all but the True Owner’ is declared in Parry v. Clissold, (1907) AC 73. In this decision it was also pointed out that if the rightful owner did not come forward and assert his title within the period of limitation, his right would be extinguished and the possessory owner acquires an absolute title. </p>
<p>The Supreme Court of India while accepting this principle in Nair Service Society Ltd. vs. K.C. Alexander, AIR 1968 SC 1165, pointed out that the <span style="text-decoration:underline">law in India allows a plaintiff to maintain a possessory suit under Sec. 9 (preset Sec. 6) of the Specific Relief Act</span>. Such a suit can be filed against a title holder, if he had dispossessed the plaintiff ‘otherwise than in due course of law’.</p>
<p>Sec. 6 of the Specific Relief Act reads as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>6. <span style="text-decoration:underline">Suit by person dispossessed of immovable property.</span></li>
<li>(1) If any person is dispossessed without his consent of immovable property otherwise than in due course of law, he or any person claiming through him may, by suit, recover possession thereof, notwithstanding any other title that may be set up in such suit.</li>
<li>(2) No suit under this section shall be brought
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>(a) after the expiry of six months from the date of dispossession; or</li>
<li>(b) against the Government.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>(3) No appeal shall lie from any order or decree passed in any suit instituted under this section, nor shall any review of any such order or decree be allowed.</li>
<li>(4) Nothing in this section shall bar any person from suing to establish his title to such property and to recover possession thereof.</li>
</ul>
<p>In Nair Service Society Ltd. vs. K.C. Alexander, AIR 1968 SC 1165, it is observed as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“17. … To express our meaning we may begin by reading 1907 AC 73 (Perry V. Clissold), to discover if the principle that <span style="text-decoration:underline">possession is good against all but the <strong>true owner</strong></span> has in any way been departed from. </li>
<li>1907 AC 73 reaffirmed the principle by stating quite clearly:
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“It cannot be disputed that a <span style="text-decoration:underline">person in possession</span> of land in the assumed character of owner and exercising peaceably the ordinary rights of ownership has a perfectly <span style="text-decoration:underline">good title against all the world but the rightful owner</span>. And if the rightful owner does not come forward and assert his title by the process of law within the period prescribed by the provisions of the statute of Limitation applicable to the case, his right is for ever extinguished and the possessory owner acquires an absolute title.”</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Therefore, the plaintiff who was peaceably in possession was entitled to remain in possession and only the State could evict him. The action of the Society was a violent invasion of his possession and <span style="text-decoration:underline">in the law as it stands in India the plaintiff could maintain a possessory suit under the provisions of the Specific Relief Act</span> in which title would be immaterial or a suit for possession within 12 years in which the question of title could be raised.”</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">If </span></strong><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Title not Perfected by Adver. Posn,  Can one eject a Trespasser After 6 Months</strong></span></p>
<p>High Courts differ, as pointed out in Kuttan Narayanan v. Thomman Mathayi, AIR 1966 Ker 179.</p>
<p>Now it is settled that if one fails to exercise his option by filing a suit under Section 6 of the Specific Relief Act within six months, he is at liberty to file a suit to recover his possession (with or without declaration) by a regular suit for recovery of possession. It can be based on title or on his possession in assumed or presumed character of ownership (even if title not perfected by doctrine of adverse possession) on the principle that  possession is good title against all the world but the rightful owner. See: Kuttan Narayanan v. Thomman Mathayi, AIR 1966 Ker 179; Kanti Lal v.  Smt. Shanti Devi, AIR 1997 Raj 230.</p>
<p><strong><u>Sec. 110 is invoked</u> <span style="text-decoration:underline">on O<span class="uppercase">wnership</span>; and NOT on ‘<span class="uppercase">title</span>‘</span></strong></p>
<p> Section 110 of the Evidence Act, 1872, speaks of the burden of proof as to ownership (contra-distinct to title): when a question arises as to whether a person in possession of anything is the owner of such thing, the burden of proving that he is not the owner is cast on the person who avers that he is not the owner.  Though it appears to be based on the principle ‘Title Follows Possession’, what is decisively articulated in this section is ‘ownership’; and not title.</p>
<p>M.  Siddiq  v. Mahant Suresh Das (Ayodhya Case), 2020-1 SCC 1, lays down (paras 784 and 785 – quoted above) the following:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>For Section 110 to be attracted, there must be a question as to <span style="text-decoration:underline">ownership</span> of anything.</li>
<li>Section 110 deals with the burden of proof.</li>
<li>The ‘thing’ must be in possession of one individual.</li>
<li>That individual is presumed to be the owner (on the principle that ‘title follows possession’. That is, possession in and of itself may raise a presumption of title.)</li>
<li>Section 110 applies when the facts disclose <span style="text-decoration:underline">no title in either of the disputants</span> in which case, possession alone decides (presumption cannot be invoked when the facts are known).</li>
<li>The law casts the burden of disproving ownership on that individual in the person who affirms that the individual in possession is not the owner.</li>
</ul>
<p>As signified in Sec. 110, Evidence Act, in law, ownership alone can be presumed; and not title. Title is the legal and authoritative expression of ownership; or, it is the legal recognition of a right.  No doubt, it is true, one can acquire title by adverse possession. But, it is said to be inchoate until the such title is upheld by a competent court.</p>
<p><strong><u>When Sec. 110 is invoked</u></strong></p>
<p>It is held in <strong>Chief Conservator of Forests v. Collectors</strong>, AIR 2003 SC 1805, that Section 110 embodies the principle that possession of a property furnishes prima facie proof of ownership of the possessor and casts burden of proof on the party who denies his ownership, and that <span style="text-decoration:underline">the presumption</span>,<span style="text-decoration:underline"> which is rebuttable, is attracted: </span></p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“when the <span style="text-decoration:underline">possession is prima facie lawful</span> and </li>
<li>when the <span style="text-decoration:underline">contesting party has no title</span>“. </li>
</ul>
<p>The Supreme Court  observed further as under: </p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“The <span style="text-decoration:underline">pattedars proved their possession</span> of the lands in question from 1312 Fasli (1902 A.D.) as pattedars. There is long and peaceful enjoyment of the lands in question but no proof of conferment of patta on the late Raja and the facts relating to acquisition of title are not known. The <span style="text-decoration:underline">appellant- State could not prove its title to the lands</span>. On these facts, the <span style="text-decoration:underline">presumption under Section 110  of the Evidence Act applies and the appellants have to prove that the pattedars </span>are not the owners. The appellants placed no evidence on record to rebut the presumption. Consequently, the pattedars, title to the land in question has to be upheld.”</li>
</ul>
<p>This principle in <span style="text-decoration:underline">Section 110 </span>of the Evidence Act is <span style="text-decoration:underline">usually adopted in cases where it is not independently possible to prove</span> <span style="text-decoration:underline">possession</span> (i) due to the nature of the property or (ii) due to the extent of the property available (Devasia @ Kutty v. Jose, 2014-4 KLJ 41; 2014-3 KLT(SN) 50). </p>
<p>It is held in <strong>Nazir Mohamed v. J.  Kamala</strong>, AIR 2020 SC 4321, as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“52. The maxim “possession follows title” is limited in its application to property, which having regard to its nature, <span style="text-decoration:underline">does not admit to actual and exclusive occupation</span>, as in the case of <span style="text-decoration:underline">open spaces accessible to all.</span> The presumption that possession must be deemed to follow title, arises only where there is<span style="text-decoration:underline"> no definite proof of possession by anyone else.</span>” </li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration:underline">When ‘Possession Follows Title</span></strong>‘<strong><span style="text-decoration:underline"> invoked</span></strong></p>
<p>In Jones v. Chopman, (1849) 2 Ex. 803: 18 LJ Ex. 456: 76 PR 794; Maule, J, expounded the doctrine  ‘Possession Follows Title’ as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“If there are two persons in a field, each asserting that the field is his, and each doing some act in the assertion of the right of possession, and if the question is, which of these two is in actual possession, <span style="text-decoration:underline">I answer, the person who has the title is in actual possession</span> and the other person is a trespasser. In such a case who is in possession is to be determined by the fact of the title and having the same apparent actual possession; The question as to which of the two really is in possession is determined by the fact of the <span style="text-decoration:underline">possession; following the title</span>, that is by the law, which makes <span style="text-decoration:underline">it follow the title</span>.” (Mitra quoted it in “Law of Possession and Ownership of Property”, as pointed out in Indore Development Authority vs. Manoharlal, (2020) 8 SCC 129)</li>
</ul>
<p> In Indore Development Authority vs. Manoharlal, (2020) 8 SCC 129, Arun Misra, J. pointed out as to possession as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“247. The concept of possession is complex one. It comprises the right to possess and to exclude others, essential is animus possidendi. Possession depends upon the character of the thing which is possessed. If the land is not capable of any use, <span style="text-decoration:underline">mere non-user of it does not lead to the inference that the owner is not in possession</span>. The established principle is that the<span style="text-decoration:underline"> possession follows title</span>. Possession comprises of the control over the property. The element of possession is the physical control or the power over the object and intention or will to exercise the power. Corpus and animus are both necessary and have to co-exist.”</li>
</ul>
<p>It held further:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“251. A person with title is considered to be in actual possession. The other person is a trespasser. The possession in law follows the right to possess as held in Kynoch Limited v. Rowlands, (1912) 1Ch 527. Ordinarily, the owner of the property is presumed to be in possession and presumption as to possession is in his favour.”</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><u>Sec. 114 Evidence Act</u></strong>– <strong><u>Title Follows Possession </u>&amp; <u>Possession Follows Title</u></strong></p>
<p>In M.  Siddiq   v. Mahant Suresh Das, 2020-1 SCC 1, the Apex Court quoted the following from <strong>State of AP v. Star Bone Mill &amp; Fertiliser Company, (2013) 9 SCC 319 </strong>where Justice B.S. Chauhan explained as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>‘21…..The said presumption is read under Section 114 of the Evidence Act and applies only in a case <span style="text-decoration:underline">where there is </span>either <span style="text-decoration:underline">no proof, </span>or very little proof <span style="text-decoration:underline">of ownership</span> on either side. The maxim – <strong>possession follows title </strong>– is applicable in cases where proof of actual possession cannot reasonably be expected, for instance, in the case of <span style="text-decoration:underline">wastelands</span>, or where nothing is known about possession one way or another. </li>
<li><strong>Presumption of title </strong>as a result of possession, can arise only where facts disclose that no title vests in any party. Possession of the plaintiff is not prima facie wrongful, and title of the plaintiff is not proved. It certainly does not mean that because a man has title over some land, he is necessarily in possession of it. It in fact means, that if at <span style="text-decoration:underline">any time a man with title</span> was in possession of the said property, the law allows the <span style="text-decoration:underline">presumption that such possession was in continuation of the title </span>vested in him. </li>
<li>A person must establish that he has continued possession of the suit property, while the other side claiming title, must make out a case of trespass/ encroachment, etc. </li>
<li>Where the apparent title is with the plaintiffs, it is <span style="text-decoration:underline">incumbent upon the defendant,</span> that in order to displace this claim of apparent title and to establish <span style="text-decoration:underline">beneficial title in himself</span>, he must establish by way of satisfactory evidence, circumstances that favour his version. </li>
<li>Even, a <span style="text-decoration:underline">revenue record</span> is not a document of title. It merely <span style="text-decoration:underline">raises a presumption </span>in regard to possession. </li>
<li><span style="text-decoration:underline">Presumption of possession</span> and/or continuity thereof, <span style="text-decoration:underline">both forward and backward,</span> can also be raised under Section 110 of the Evidence Act.’ ”</li>
</ul>
<p>In Anathula Sudhakar  v. Buchi Reddy, AIR 2008 SC 2033, Apex Court held as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“But what if the property is a vacant site, which is not physically possessed, used or enjoyed? In such cases the principle is that <span style="text-decoration:underline"><strong>possession follows title</strong></span>. If two persons claim to be in possession of a <span style="text-decoration:underline">vacant site,</span> one who is able to establish title thereto will be considered to be in possession, as against the person who is not able to establish title. This means that even though a suit relating to a vacant site is for a mere injunction and the issue is one of possession, it will be necessary to examine and determine the title as a prelude for deciding the de jure possession.”</li>
</ul>
<p>In Arumaraj Devadhas v. K. Sundaram Nadar, 2009-17 SCC 467, also it was held that the principle <span style="text-decoration:underline">possession follows title</span> applies <span style="text-decoration:underline">in vacant land</span>. This principle is applied in ‘<span style="text-decoration:underline">open space</span>‘ in Praprai N Kothari Vs. John Braganza, AIR 1999 SC 1666 and in Rajendar Singh Vs. Santa Singh, AIR 1973 SC 2537. In<strong> </strong>Naval Shankar Ishwarlal Dave v. State of Gujarat, AIR 1994 SC 1496,  the Apex Court observed that it was ‘settled law that in respect of <span style="text-decoration:underline">open land</span>, title follows possession’. In  Kashi Bai v. Sudha Rani Ghose, AIR 1958 SC 434, it was observed that when the land was vacant and was lying open, it was presumed to be that of the owner (possession follows title).</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration:underline"><strong>Possession Follows Title</strong></span><strong><span style="text-decoration:underline"> and Adverse Possession</span></strong></p>
<p>It is held in<strong> MS Jagadambal v. Southern Indian Education Trust, 1988 (Supp) SCC 144</strong> that the <span style="text-decoration:underline">possession continues with the title</span> holder unless and <span style="text-decoration:underline">until</span> the defendant acquires title by <span style="text-decoration:underline">adverse possession</span> (possession follows title). In LN Aswathama v. P Prakash, 2009-13 SCC 229, the Supreme Court held as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“In law, <span style="text-decoration:underline"><strong>possession follows title</strong></span>. The plaintiffs having established title to the suit property, will be entitled to decree for possession, <span style="text-decoration:underline">unless their right to the suit property was extinguished, by</span> reason of defendant being in<span style="text-decoration:underline"> adverse possession</span> for a period of twelve years prior to the suit.”</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration:underline">When the  principles in Sec. 110 and 114 CANNOT be invoked</span></strong></p>
<p>As we find in M.  Siddiq  v. Mahant Suresh Das (Ayodhya Case), 2020-1 SCC 1, Section 110 or the principle ‘<span style="text-decoration:underline">title follows possession</span>‘ applies <span style="text-decoration:underline">when the facts disclose no title</span> in either of the disputants in which case, possession alone decides (presumption cannot be invoked when the facts are known). But, with respect to the principle ‘<span style="text-decoration:underline">possession follows title</span>‘, as we find in Anathula Sudhakar  v. Buchi Reddy, AIR 2008 SC 2033, <span style="text-decoration:underline">if only title is proved</span> by one party, then only the principle ‘possession follows title’ comes in.</p>
<p>It is equally important that both these principles on presumption, ‘possession follows title’ and ‘title follows possession’, cannot be invoked in cases where:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>(i)</strong> the defendants do not claim title/possession to the suit property (Devasia @ Kutty v. Jose, 2014-4 KLJ 41; 2014-3 KLT(SN) 50).</li>
<li><strong>(ii) </strong>the facts (on title/possession) are known (M.  Siddiq   v. Mahant Suresh Das, 2020-1 SCC 1), or</li>
<li>there is evidence of independent possession/title (Bhavnagar Municipality Vs. Union of India, AIR 1990 SC 717).</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="text-decoration:underline"><strong>M</strong></span><strong><span style="text-decoration:underline">utation will not confer ‘title’</span></strong></p>
<p>It is a settled proposition of law (i) that the mutation entry in revenue documents will not confer any right, title or interest in favour of any person and (ii) that the mutation in the revenue record is only for the fiscal purpose. After pointing out these legal propositions it is observed in <strong>Jitendra Singh vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh, 2021 SCC OnLine SC 802</strong>, as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“6. Right from 1997, the law is very clear. In the case of Balwant Singh v. Daulat Singh (D) By Lrs., reported in (1997) 7 SCC 137 , this Court had an occasion to consider the effect of mutation and it is observed and held that mutation of property in <span style="text-decoration:underline">revenue records neither creates nor extinguishes title</span> to the property nor has it any presumptive value on title. Such entries are relevant only for the purpose of collecting land revenue. Similar view has been expressed in the series of decisions thereafter. </li>
<li>6.1 In the case of Suraj Bhan v. Financial Commissioner, (2007) 6 SCC 186 , it is observed and held by this Court that an entry in <span style="text-decoration:underline">revenue records does not confer title</span> on a person whose name appears in record-of-rights. Entries in the revenue records or jamabandi have <span style="text-decoration:underline">only “fiscal purpose”</span>, i.e., payment of land revenue, and <span style="text-decoration:underline">no ownership is conferred on the basis of such entries</span>. It is further observed that so far as the t<span style="text-decoration:underline">itle of the property</span> is concerned, it can <span style="text-decoration:underline">only be decided by a competent civil court.</span> Similar view has been expressed in the cases of Suman Verma v. Union of India, (2004) 12 SCC 58; Faqruddin v. Tajuddin (2008) 8 SCC 12; Rajinder Singh v. State of J&amp;K, (2008) 9 SCC 368; Municipal Corporation, Aurangabad v.

<p><strong><u>Revenue Records Do Not Confer Presumptive Value on Title</u></strong></p>
<p>The Supreme Court in  Smt. Bhimabai Mahadeo Kambekar v. Arthur Import and Export Company (2019) and Commissioner, Bruhath Bangalore Mahanagra Palike vs Faraulla Khan (2021)<em><strong> </strong>observed that mutation in revenue records will not confer or lose title</em> (Relied on <em>Sawarni (Smt.) Vs. Inder Kaur (1996) 6 SCC 223, Balwant Singh &amp; Anr. Vs. Daulat Singh (dead) by L.Rs. &amp; Ors. (1997) 7 SCC 137,  Narasamma &amp; Ors. Vs. State of Karnataka &amp; Ors. (2009) 5 SCC 591).</em></p>
<p>As pointed out above, it is observed by the Apex Court in <strong>State of AP v. Star Bone Mill &amp; Fertiliser Company, (2013) 9 SCC 319 </strong>that a <span style="text-decoration:underline">revenue record</span> is not a document of title; it merely <span style="text-decoration:underline">raises a presumption in regard to possession</span> (Quoted in M.  Siddiq   v. Mahant Suresh Das, 2020-1 SCC 1). The argument as to ownership based upon entries in the revenue records had been negated in Prahlad Pradhan  v. Sonu Kumhar,<strong><em> </em></strong>(2019) 10 SCC 259.  It was held that the revenue record does not confer title to the property nor do they have any presumptive value on the title. (Quoted in Prabhagiya Van Adhikari Awadh Van Prabhag v. Arun Kumar Bhardwaj (SC): 2021)</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration:underline">Possession is a Good Title of right Against any one who cannot Show a Better</span></strong></p>
<p>In Poona Ram v. Moti Ram, AIR 2019 SC 813, our Apex Court explained the principle ‘possession is a good title of right against any one who cannot show a better’ as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“9. The law in India, as it has developed, accords with jurisprudential thought as propounded by luminaries like Salmond. Salmond on Jurisprudence  states:­
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“These two concepts of ownership and possession, therefore, may be used to distinguish between the de facto possessor of an object and its de jure owner, between the man who actually has it and the man who ought to have it. They serve also to contract the position of one whose rights are ultimate, permanent and residual with that of one whose rights are only of a temporary nature.</li>
<li>x x x x x In English law possession is a good title of right against any one who cannot show a better. <span style="text-decoration:underline">A wrongful possessor has the rights of an owner with respect to all persons except earlier possessors and except the true owner himself.</span> Many other legal systems, however, go much further than this, and treat possession as a provisional or temporary title even against the true owner himself. Even a wrongdoer, who is deprived of his possession, can recover it from any person whatever, simply on the ground of his possession. Even the true owner, who takes his own, may be forced in this way to  restore it to the wrongdoer, and will not be permitted to set up his own superior title to it. He must first give up possession, and then proceed in due course of law for the recovery of the thing on the ground of his ownership. The intention of the law is that every possessor shall be entitled to retain and recover his possession, until deprived of it by a judgment according to law.</li>
<li>Legal remedies thus appointed for the protection of possession even against ownership are called possessory, while those available for the protection of ownership itself may be distinguished as proprietary. In the modern and medieval civil law the distinction is expressed by the contrasted terms petitorium (a proprietary suit) and possessorium (a possessory suit).”</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>10. As far back as 1924, in the case of Midnapur Zamindary Co. Ltd. v. Naresh Narayan Roy, AIR 1924 PC 144, the learned Judge observed that in India, persons are not permitted to take forcible possession; they must obtain such possession as they are entitled to through a court. Later, in the case of <span style="text-decoration:underline">Nair Service Society Ltd. v. K.C. Alexander</span>, AIR 1968 SC 1165, this Court ruled that <span style="text-decoration:underline">when the facts disclose no title in either party, possession alone decides</span>. It was further held that if Section 9 of the Specific Relief Act, 1877 (corresponding to the present Section6) is employed, the plaintiff need not prove title and the title of the defendant does not avail him. When, however, the period of six months has passed, questions of title can be raised by the defendant, and if he does so the plaintiff must establish a better title or fail. In other words, such a right is only restricted to possession in a suit under Section 9 of the Specific Relief Act (corresponding to the present Section 6) but does not bar a suit on prior possession within 12 years from the date of dispossession, and title need not be proved unless the defendant can provide one.</li>
<li>11. It was also observed by this Court in Nair Service Society Ltd (supra) that a person in possession of land in assumed character of owner and exercising peaceably the ordinary rights of ownership has a <span style="text-decoration:underline">perfectly good title against the entire world except the rightful owner</span>. In such a case, the defendant must show in himself or his predecessor a valid legal title and probably a possession prior to the plaintiff’s, and thus be able to raise a presumption prior in time.”</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration:underline">Settled Possession and Established Possession</span> </strong></p>
<p>In A. Subramanian v. R. Pannerselvam, AIR 2021 SC 821, the Supreme Court held that even a trespasser, who is in established possession of the property could obtain injunction. But, it was cautioned that  the matter would be different, if the plaintiff himself elaborated in the plaint about title dispute and fails to make a prayer for declaration of title along with injunction relief. </p>
<p>In Poona Ram v. Moti Ram, AIR 2019 SC 813, it was pointed out in a case where there was no document to prove settled possession that ‘merely on doubtful material and cursory evidence, it cannot be held that the plaintiff was ever in possession of the property, and that too in settled possession’. It held further as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“13. The crux of the matter is that a person who asserts possessory title over a particular property will have to show that he is under <span style="text-decoration:underline">settled or established possession</span> of the said property. But merely <span style="text-decoration:underline">stray or intermittent acts of trespass do not give such a right</span> against the true owner. Settled possession means such possession over the property which has existed for a <span style="text-decoration:underline">sufficiently long period of time</span>, and has been <span style="text-decoration:underline">acquiesced to by the true owner.</span> A casual act of possession does not have the effect of interrupting the possession of the rightful owner. A stray act of trespass, or a possession which has not matured into settled possession, can be obstructed or removed by the true owner even by using necessary force. Settled possession must be <span style="text-decoration:underline">(i) effective,(ii) undisturbed, and (iii) to the knowledge of the owner</span> or without any attempt at concealment by the trespasser. There <span style="text-decoration:underline">cannot be a straitjacket formula </span>to determine settled possession. Occupation of a property by a person as an agent or a servant acting at the instance of the owner will not amount to actual legal possession. The possession should contain an element of animus possidendi. The nature of possession of the trespasser is to be decided based on the facts and circumstances of each case.”</li>

<p><strong><span style="text-decoration:underline">Possession is Heritable and Transferable</span></strong></p>
<p>Possession by itself is a <span style="text-decoration:underline">substantive right</span> recognised by law. It is <span style="text-decoration:underline">heritable and transferable.</span> (Kuttan Narayanan v. Thomman Mathayi, AIR 1966 Ker 179; Phirayalal Kapur Vs. Jia Rani, AIR 1973 Delhi 186; Nallammal Vs. Ayisha Beevi, 2017-5 Mad LJ 864).  </p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration:underline">Injunction is a Possessory Remedy. </span></strong></p>
<p>Courts protect settled possession (Rame Gowda  v.  M. Varadappa Naidu, 2004-1 SCC 769).  Injunction is a possessory remedy. (See: Ladies Corner, Bangalore vs State of Karnataka, ILR 1987 KAR 1710, 1987 (1) KarLJ 402. Patil Exhibitors (Pvt.) Ltd. vs The Corporation of The City (M Venikatachaliah, J.) : AIR 1986 Kant 194, ILR 1985 KAR 3700, 1985 (2) KarLJ 533. Referred to in Chetak Constructions Vs. Om Prakash, AIR 2003 MP 145. )</p>
<p>But, an injunction cannot be issued against a true owner or title holder and in favour of a trespasser or a person in unlawful possession. See: Padhiyar Prahladji Chenaji vs Maniben Jagmalbhai: 2022 SCC OnLine SC 258.</p>

<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">Kesar Bai v. Genda Lal – HC and SC Approached in different Perspectives</span></strong></p>
<p>Kesar Bai v. Genda Lal, 2022-10 SCC 217, arose from a suit seeking declaration of ownership and permanent injunction. The findings of the High Court were the following:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>the plea of ownership claimed by the plaintiff based on a sale deed and the plea of adverse possession were contrary to each other;</li>
<li>the plaintiffs could not have been permitted to take both the pleas at the same time;</li>
<li>but, in view of the fact that the plaintiff was in possession of the suit land since the execution of the said sale deed, the plaintiff was entitled for injunction on the basis of his possession.</li>
</ul>
<p>Setting aside the High Court judgment the Apex Court held as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“The possession/alleged possession of the plaintiffs could not have been protected by passing a decree of permanent injunction in favour of the plaintiffs”.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Should the Defendant-Rightful-Owner Approach the Court Again For Recovery?</strong></p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Before Kesar Bai v. Genda Lal, our Apex Court held in <strong>Padhiyar Prahladji Chenaji v. Maniben Jagmalbhai</strong>, 2022 SCC OnLine SC 258 (<strong>M.R. Shah</strong>, B.V. Nagarathna, JJ.) to the following effect (see ‘End Notes’ below):</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>The plaintiff is not entitled to any injunction and/or protect his possession against the rightful owner, more particularly, when he fails to get the declaratory relief with respect to the title.</li>
<li>In a suit for permanent injunction to restrain the defendant from interfering with the plaintiff’s possession, the <mark>only thing the plaintiff will have to establish is that as on the date of the suit, he was in lawful possession o</mark>f the suit property and the defendant has tried to interfere or disturb his possession</li>
<li>the plaintiff, who has failed to get any declaratory relief on title cannot be said to be in “lawful possession”. Only when the person seeking the relief is <mark>in lawful possession </mark>and enjoyment of the property, he is legally entitled to be in possession, and not to disposes him, except in due process of law.</li>
<li>The contention of the plaintiff that even if the plaintiff failed to get the declaratory relief and the suit is dismissed, once the plaintiff is found to be in possession, her possession cannot be disturbed except in <strong><u>due process of law</u></strong> and the only remedy available to the defendant would be “to file a substantive suit to get back the possession is noticed only to be rejected outright”<strong>.</strong></li>
<li>In <strong>Maria Margarida Sequeira Fernandes Vs. Erasmo Jack de Sequeira, (2012) 5 SCC 370,</strong> it was held that the ‘due process’ or ‘due course’ condition was satisfied the moment the rights of the parties were adjudicated upon by a court of competent jurisdiction, and that it did not matter who brought the action to court.</li>
<li>In Maria Margarida Sequeira Fernandes Vs. Erasmo Jack de Sequeira, the Court has approved the following findings of the High Court of Delhi in Thomas Cook (India) Ltd. Vs. Hotel Imperial (2006) 88 DRJ 545:
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“In this context, when a party approaches a court seeking a protective remedy such as an injunction and it fails in setting up a good case, <mark>can it then say that the other party must now institute an action in a court of law for enforcing his rights</mark> i.e. for taking back something from the first party who holds it unlawfully, and, till such time, the court hearing the injunction action must grant an injunction anyway? <mark>I would think not</mark>.”</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><u>Even the Rightful Owner is NOT entitled to Eject a Trespasser, by Force</u></strong></p>
<p>It goes without saying that the the rightful owner is not legally entitled to eject the interloper or trespasser by force, otherwise than by due process of law; especially when the trespasser is in settled possession. </p>
<p>In Karthiyayani Amma v. Govindan, AIR 1980 Ker 224, the High Court considered the question whether the rightful owner can eject a trespasser in possession with force; and whether a person in illegal possession could sustain a suit for injunction against the true owner, from forcibly dispossessing him from the property.  It was held as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“The ultimate position, therefore, reduces itself to this:</li>
<li>Can a person in possession without title sustain a suit for injunction against the rightful owner if he proves possession?</li>
<li>Yes.</li>
<li>In this case, plaintiff is found to in be possession. On the finding, he should be granted the injunction prayed for. A person in possession can be evicted only in due process of law. <span style="text-decoration: underline">Even the rightful owner cannot eject him with force.</span> If he cannot be evicted with force, he continues to be in possession and he can resist invasion of his possession by everyone including the rightful owner. If the rightful owner threatens his peaceful possession, he can approach Courts of Law and pray for the equitable relief of injunction to protect his possession”. (Followed in Aiysumma Vs. Mariyamma, 1994-2 CIVCC 52, 1994-1 KerLT 570. )</li>
</ul>
<p>It is pointed out in Suresh v. Ashok Girdharilal Chandak, 2016-1 MHLJ 171 that ‘bearing in mind the basic principle of law in civil jurisprudence that <span style="text-decoration: underline">even a trespasser cannot be evicted without following due process of law</span> and no one can be allowed to take law into his own hands to recover possession of the property without following due process of law and without proving title to the immovable property in possession of a person holding actual physical possession thereof’.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration:underline"><strong>Person in possession can use Reasonable Force to keep out a Trespasser</strong></span></p>
<p>In Rame Gowda v. M. Varadappa Naidu, (2004) 1 SCC 769, our Apex Court  Court, observed as under:­  </p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“8. It is thus clear that so far as the Indian law is concerned the <span style="text-decoration:underline">person in peaceful possession is entitled to retain his possession</span> and in order <span style="text-decoration:underline">to protect such possession he may even use reasonable force to keep out a trespasser</span>. </li>
<li>A rightful owner who has been <span style="text-decoration:underline">wrongfully dispossessed of land may retake possession</span> <span style="text-decoration:underline">if he can do so peacefully</span> and without the use of unreasonable force. </li>
<li>If the trespasser is in <span style="text-decoration:underline">settled possession </span>of the property belonging to the rightful owner, the <span style="text-decoration:underline">rightful owner shall have to take recourse to law</span>; he cannot take the law in his own hands and evict the trespasser or interfere with his possession. </li>
<li><span style="text-decoration:underline">The law will</span> come to the aid of a person in peaceful and settled possession by <span style="text-decoration: underline">injuncting even a rightful owner from using force or taking law in his own hands</span>, and also by restoring him in possession even from the rightful owner (of course subject to the law of limitation), if the latter has dispossessed the prior possessor by use of force. </li>
<li>In the absence of proof of better title, <span style="text-decoration:underline">possession or prior peaceful settled possession is itself evidence of title</span>. <span style="text-decoration:underline"><strong>Law presumes the possession to go with the title unless rebutted</strong></span>. The owner of any property may prevent even by using reasonable force a trespasser from an attempted trespass, when it is in the process of being committed, or is of a flimsy character, or recurring, intermittent, stray or casual in nature, or has just been committed, while the rightful owner did not have enough time to have recourse to law. In the last of the cases, the possession of the trespasser, just entered into would not be called as one acquiesced to by the true owner.” (quoted in: Subramanya Swamy Temple, Ratnagiri v. V. Kanna Gounder, 2009-3 SCC 306)</li>
</ul>
<p>What is the settled possession or effective possession of a person without title which would entitle him to protect his possession even as against the true owner was made clear in Rame Gowda v. M. Varadappa Naidu, (2004) 1 SCC 769. It reads as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“9. …The “settled possession” must be (i) effective, (ii) undisturbed, and (iii) to the knowledge of the owner or without any attempt at concealment by the trespasser. The phrase “settled possession” does not carry any special charm or magic in it; nor is it a ritualistic formula which can be confined in a straitjacket. An occupation of the property by a person as an agent or a servant acting at the instance of the owner will not amount to actual physical possession.” (quoted in Samarpan Varishtha Jan Parisar vs Rajendra Prasad Agarwal, 2022 SCC OnLine SC 564)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration:underline">No decree for recovery</span> <span style="text-decoration:underline">unless ‘present right to the possession’</span></strong></p>
<p>While considering the question whether a worshipper can file a suit for recovery, it is held by our Apex Court, in M Siddiq Vs. Mahanth Suresh Das (Ayodhya Case) 2019-1 SCC 1, that <span style="text-decoration:underline">no decree for recovery</span> of possession can be made in such a suit <span style="text-decoration:underline">unless the worshipper has the ‘present right to the possession’</span>. But it is pointed out that i<span style="text-decoration:underline">n such situations, a worshipper must be permitted to sue as next friend of the deity</span>, sue on behalf of the idol itself – directly exercising the deity’s right to sue.</p>
