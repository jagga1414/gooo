<p><strong><u>‘Freeholds (Adhikara Ozhivus)’ in Edavagai Lands of Travancore</u></strong></p>
<p>In erstwhile Travancore, </p>

<p>administered Edavagais of –</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Edapally, Kilimanoor, Poonjar and Vanjipuzha.</li>
</ul>
<p>The chiefs or administers of those Edavagais were vassals of erstwhile Kingdom of Travancore. Those chiefs were allowed to administer (collect rent or tax from the tenants) of those Edavagais. The Travancore Govt. did not collect tax directly from those Edavagai Lands. Therefore, it was said that those lands were ‘freeholds (Adhikara Ozhivus)’. </p>
<p>In Harska Trust v. State of Kerala, ILR  1960 Ker 345, 1960 Ker LT 378, the reason for non-collection of Tax from Edavagais was also laid down as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“Edavagais were petty kingdoms or principalities which remained independent or quasi-independent until the consolidation of Travancore in the 18th century. They were <span style="text-decoration: underline">outside the State Ayacut and paid no land tax</span>. The Chiefs, however, in exercise of their ancient sovereign powers, collected Melvaram or Melvara Rajabhogam from the jenmis inside the Edavagais (See: 1945 TLR 581 and 728).”</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><u>“Freehold” (also) used to denote</u><span style="text-decoration: underline"> a Class</span>, <u>Exempted from “Payment of Tax”</u></strong></p>
<p>Travancore State Manual Vol. III published by the Travancore Government in 1940, while listing <span style="text-decoration: underline">various classes of jenmom land</span>s, it says about a class which were entirely ‘<strong><mark class="has-inline-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#780ade">freehold</mark></strong>‘ and <strong><u>exempted from payment of any kind of tax</u></strong> to Government under any circumstances. These were the special properties given by the Ruler to certain individuals considering their valid services, or to certain institutions including temples. They were also called ‘freehold’ (though generally the term ‘freehold’ conveyed another idea).</p>
<p><strong><u>‘Jenmam’ </u></strong>(<span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong><mark class="has-inline-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#780ade">freehold</mark></strong> right) is ‘Estate’ within <strong>Article 31A</strong></span></p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>In K. K. Kochunni v. States of Madras and Kerala, AIR 1960 SC 1080 and Govindaru Nambooripad v. State of Kerala, 1962 Ker LT 913 :  AIR 1963 Ker 86 it was held that jenmom right was the <strong><strong><mark class="has-inline-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#780ade">freehold</mark></strong></strong> right with ‘proprietary interest’.</li>
</ul>
<p>The concepts on ‘janmam’ continued even after introduction of Tax system by Government. ‘Jenmom’ was taken the proprietary interest of a landlord in lands (Kavalappara Kottarathil Kochuni v. States of Madras and Kerala, AIR 1960 SC 1080). Subba Rao, J., observed as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“Under the definition, any janmam right in Kerala is an “estate”. <span style="text-decoration: underline">A janmam right is the <strong><strong><mark class="has-inline-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#780ade">freehold</mark></strong> interest</strong></span><strong> </strong>in a property situated in Kerala.</li>
<li>Moor in his “Malabar Law and Custom” describes it as a hereditary proprietorship. A janmam interest may, therefore, be described as  “<strong>proprietary interest of a landlord in lands</strong>” and such a janmam right is described as <span style="text-decoration: underline">“estate” in the Constitution</span>. Substituting “janmam right” in place of “estate” in cl. 2 (b), the “rights” in <strong>Art. 31A (1) (a)</strong> will include the rights of a proprietor and subordinate tenure-holders in respect of a janmam right.</li>
<li>It follows that the extinguishment or modification of a right refers to the rights of a proprietor or a subordinate tenure-holder in the janmam right. A proprietor called the janmi or his subordinate tenure-holder has certain defined rights in janmam right”. Land-tenures in Malabar are established by precedents or immemorial usage. J<span style="text-decoration: underline">anmam right is a <strong><strong><mark class="has-inline-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#780ade">freehold</mark></strong> interest</strong></span> in property and the landlord is called  “janmi”. He can create many subordinate interests or tenures therein.” (Quoted in: Kannan Devan Hills Produce v.  The State of Kerala, AIR 1972 SC 2301)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><u><strong>“Janmam right” can be vested with</strong> <strong>Sircar </strong>(Not with holders,<strong> </strong>alone)</u></strong></p>
<p>The Supreme Court, in Kannan Devan Hills Produce v. The State Of Kerala, AIR 1972 SC 2301 (Sikri (Cj), Shelat, A.N. Ray, I.D. Dua, , H.R.  Khanna, JJ.) held that Kenan Devan Hills Concession (<u>on grant deeds</u>) fall within the expression<strong> “Janmam right” vested with</strong> <strong>Sircar </strong>(not solely with holders<strong> </strong>of the land). This land is dealt with under the heading – <strong>Pandaravaka Lands, i.e. lands belonging to the Sircar.</strong></p>
<p>The Apex Court found the following:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>The janmam rights (even if remained with the Poonjar Chief, H.H. the <strong>Maharaja became the janmi </strong>by the Royal proclamation of 1899.</li>
<li>The nature of ‘janmam right’ has been examined by this Court previously in Kavalappara Kottarathil Kochuni v. State of Madras [1960] 3 S.C.R. 887 Subba Rao, J., observed that janmam right in Kerala is an “estate” and it <strong>is the <mark class="has-inline-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#780ade"><strong><mark class="has-inline-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#780ade">freehold</mark></strong></mark> interest.</strong></li>
<li>The <strong>Sircar itself is one of these janmis and it was the largest Janmi</strong>. It came to possess janmam lands by gift, purchase, escheat, confiscation and other ways</li>
<li>If any person wants land in Travancore, he must obtain it from, some one of the body of Janmis, i.e. from the Sircar, which is the Chief Janmi, or from some other Janmi.</li>

<p>‘<strong><u><mark class="has-inline-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#bd0606">Grant’ will not confer <strong>Absolute Proprietary Rights</strong> </mark></u></strong></p>
<p>In <strong><u>State of Kerala v. Kanan Devan Hills Produce Co. Ltd., (1991) 2 SCC 272</u></strong> the Apex Court came to the conclusion that the the <mark class="has-inline-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#6007b3"><strong>company did not</strong> <strong><u>acquire</u></strong> <strong>absolute proprietary rights</strong> <strong>over the Concession/granted Area</strong></mark>. With respect to the same property  it was held in State of Kerala v. Kannan Devan Hills Produce Co. Ltd., (1991) 2 SCC 272<strong>, </strong>as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“The Trial Court in a detailed and well-reasoned judgment dismissed the suit of the company. <strong><u>The Trial Court </u></strong>on the interpretation of First Concession (Exhibit P- 1), Second Concession (Exhibit P-2), deed of ratification (Exhibit P-62) and the Government agreement with the Society dated August 2, 1866 (Exhibit P-64) <strong><u>came to the conclusion </u></strong>that the <mark class="has-inline-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#6406bc"><strong>company did not</strong> <strong><u>acquire</u></strong> <strong>absolute proprietary rights</strong> <strong>over the Concession Area</strong> </mark>or the trees and timber in the said area. It was held that the Poonjar Chief had only conveyed heritable and transferable possessory rights over the Concession area to the <strong>grantee</strong>. It was also held that absolute rights over the trees and timber in the Concession Area did not pass to the <strong>grantee</strong> and it had only the right to use and remove timber subject to the restrictions imposed in the deeds of conveyance/ratification.”</li>
</ul>
<p>The Apex Court referred to a Full Bench decision of the Kerala High Court in <strong>George A Leslie v. State of Kerala, [1969] K. L.T. 378,</strong> K. K. Mathew, J. (as the learned Judge then was) that interpreted the clause in a similar deed.</p>
<p>Then it is observed further:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“<strong><u>We agree with the interpretation</u></strong> given to the clause by Mathew, J. and hold that the respondent- <strong><mark class="has-inline-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#6209b6">company <u>did not acquire absolute proprietary rights over the Concession Area</u></mark></strong> or the trees and the timber therein.”</li>
</ul>
<p>The Apex Court (in State of Kerala v. Kannan Devan Hills, (1991) 2 SCC 272<span style="text-decoration: underline">)</span> upheld and approved “the judgment and findings” of the Trial Court.</p>
<p><strong><u>History of Land Tax Collection from Edavagai Lands</u></strong></p>
<p>Harska Trust v. State of Kerala, ILR  1960 Ker 345, 1960 Ker LT 378, clearly lays down the history. It is pointed out that the collection of Basic-Tax was first introduced by the Travancore Land Tax Proclamation, 1121. Sec. 6 of the Proclamation provided that the Proclamation would not be applicable to certain classes of lands. One of those classes was-</p>
<p>As pointed out in Harska Trust v. State of Kerala, ILR  1960 Ker 345, the next enactment was the Travancore-Cochin Land Tax Act, 1955 which came into force on 1-4-1956. Sec. 17 of the Land Tax Act, 1955, repealed the Travancore Land Tax Proclamation, 1121 (1946).</p>
<p><strong><u>Jenmam </u></strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">– <strong>Proprietary right in the soil</strong></span></p>
<p>In K. K. Kochunni v. States of Madras and Kerala, AIR 1960 SC 1080, the Supreme Court, while dealing with Article 31A of the Constitution, said:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“Under the definition, any jenmom right in Kerala is an ‘estate’. A <strong>jenmom right is the</strong> <strong><strong><mark class="has-inline-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#780ade">freehold</mark></strong> </strong>interest in a property situated in Kerala. Moor in his “Malabar Law and Custom” describes it as a hereditary proprietorship. A jenmom interest may, therefore be described as ‘proprietary interest of a landlord in lands‘.”</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><u>Edavagai Rights Act, 1955 did Not change Character of Holdings</u></strong></p>
<p>The object behind the act is very clear – it was only to ‘acquire’ the rights of the Edavagais; it was not to change the character of the land held by the tenants or purchasers.</p>
<p><u>Lease holdings of the Edavagais continued as Lease holdings</u>, but with liability to pay Tax.</p>
<p>In <strong>Harrisons Malayalam Limited v. State of Kerala</strong>, 2018-2 KLT 369, it is pointed out analysing Edavagai Rights Acquisition Act, 1955 as under-</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“There was also <span style="text-decoration: underline">a saving clause</span> in Section 11 which exempted from vesting, those lands held by the <span style="text-decoration: underline">Chiefs as a Jenmy</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline">or as a pattadar</span> under the Government and those held by the families, already settled and assessed, <span style="text-decoration: underline">as also</span> those <span style="text-decoration: underline">lands in the direct possession of the Chiefs </span>and any of the members of the respective families.”</li>
</ul>
<p>Then it is observed by the High Court of Kerala as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“<span style="text-decoration: underline">Hence land existing on a <strong>lease</strong></span> from either of the Edavagais or
