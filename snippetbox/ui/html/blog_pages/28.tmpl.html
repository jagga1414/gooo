<p><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Introduction</span></p>
<p>“Ubi Jus Ibi Remedium” (where there is a right, there is a remedy) is a fundamental principle of civil law. It ensures that if and when a Civil Right is infringed, law confers a civil remedy. It includes:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>Declaration</li><li>Injunction or recovery, or</li><li>Damages or compensation.</li></ul>
<p>Section 9 CPC is casted in enforcement of the principle, “Ubi Jus Ibi Remedium”. The jurisdiction of the Civil Court under Section 9 is a plenary one.</p>
<p><strong><u>Section 9 of CPC reads as under:</u></strong></p>
<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>9. Courts to try all civil suits unless barred—The Courts shall (subject to the provisions herein contained) have jurisdiction to try all suits of a civil nature excepting suits of which their cognizance is either expressly or impliedly barred.</li></ul>

<p><strong><u>Pecuniary &amp; Territorial <strong>(Place of Filing)</strong> Jurisdiction in Civil Suits</u></strong></p>
<p>The Civil Procedure Code governs the law as to the court in which a civil suit is to be filed.  Various aspects as to the same are contained in Sec. 15 to 21 of the CPC, under the caption ‘Place of Suing’.</p>
<p>With respect to the jurisdiction of courts, it is held in Harshad Chiman Lal Modi v. DLF Universal Ltd., AIR 2005 SC 4446, as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>“The jurisdiction of a court may be classified into several categories. The important categories are:<ul><li>(i)   Territorial or local jurisdiction;</li><li>(ii)  Pecuniary jurisdiction; and</li><li>(iii) Jurisdiction over the subject matter.</li></ul></li></ul>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Sec. 15 to 21 of the CPC</span></strong> <strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">read as under:</span></strong></p>

<p><strong><u>Defect on the basis of Pecuniary and Territorial Jurisdiction</u></strong></p>
<p>Generally speaking, the defects on the basis of pecuniary and territorial jurisdiction are not so serious compared to the defect for lack of jurisdiction in the subject matter or inherent lack of jurisdiction. It is reflected in Sec. 21, 21A, 99 and 99A, CPC.</p>
<p>Section 21, 21A, 99 and 99A CPC reads as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list"><li><strong>21</strong>. <strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Objections to jurisdiction</span></strong>. </li><li>(1)] No objection as to the place of suing shall be allowed by any appellate or Revisional Court unless such objection was taken in the Court of first instance at the earliest possible opportunity and in all cases where issues or settled at or before such settlement, and unless there has been a consequent failure of justice.</li><li>(2) No objection as to the competence of a Court with reference to the pecuniary limits of its jurisdiction shall be allowed by any Appellate or Revisional Court unless such objection was taken in the Court of first instance at the earliest possible opportunity, and in all cases where issues are settled, at or before such settlement, and unless there has been a consequent failure of justice.</li><li>(3) No objection as to the competence of the executing Court with reference to the local limits of its jurisdiction shall be allowed by any Appellate or Revisional Court unless such objection was taken in the executing Court at the earliest possible opportunity, and unless there has been a consequent failure of justice.]</li></ul>
<ul class="wp-block-list"><li><strong>21A. <u>Bar on suit to set aside decree on objection as to place of suing</u></strong>. </li><li>No suit shall lie challenging the validity of a decree passed in a former suit between the same parties, or between the parties under whom they or any of them claim, litigating under the same title, on any ground based on an objection as to the place of suing.</li><li>Explanation.-The expression “former suit” means a suit which has been decided prior to the decision in the suit in which the validity of the decree is questioned, whether or not the previously decided suit was instituted prior to the suit in which the validity of such decree is questioned. </li></ul>
<ul class="wp-block-list"><li><strong>99.</strong> <strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">No decree to be reversed or modified for error or irregularity not affecting merits or jurisdiction</span></strong>. </li><li>No decree shall be reversed or substantially varied, nor shall any case be remanded in appeal on account of any misjoinder or non-joinder of parties or causes of action or any error, defect or irregularity in any proceedings in the suit, not affecting the merits of the case or the jurisdiction of the Court.</li><li>Provided that nothing in this section shall apply to non-joinder of a necessary party.</li></ul>
<ul class="wp-block-list"><li><strong>99A. <span style="text-decoration:underline;">No order under section 47 to be refused or modified unless decision of the case is prejudicially affected</span></strong>.</li><li>Without prejudice to the generality of the provisions of section 99, no order under section 47 shall be reversed or substantially varied, on account of any error, defect or irregularity in any proceeding relating to such order, unless such error, defect or irregularity has prejudicially affected the decision of the case.</li></ul>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">No reversal purely on Technical Grounds, unless Failure of Justice</span></strong></p>
<p>In Kiran Singh v. Chaman Paswan, AIR 1954 SC 340,  it was observed as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>“The policy underlying sections 21 and 99 of the Civil Procedure Code and Section 11 of the Suits Valuation Act is the same, namely, that when a case had been tried by a Court on the merits and judgment rendered, it <span style="text-decoration:underline;">should not be liable to be reversed purely on technical grounds, unless it had resulted in failure of justice</span>, and the policy of the Legislature has been to treat objections to jurisdiction both territorial and pecuniary as technical and not open to consideration by an appellate Court, unless there has been a prejudice on the merits”</li></ul>

<p><strong><u>Section 21A CPC Takes-in Objection as to Pecuniary Jurisdiction also</u></strong></p>
<p>In Subhas Mahadevasa Habib v. Nemasa Ambasa Dharmadas, AIR 2007 SC 1828, it is held as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>“Though Section 21A of the Code speaks of a suit not being maintainable for challenging the validity of a prior decree between the same parties on a ground based on an objection as to “the place of suing”, there is no reason to restrict its operation only to an objection based on territorial jurisdiction and excluding from its purview a defect based on pecuniary jurisdiction.”</li></ul>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">When parties, by agreement, to confer jurisdiction on a Court </span></strong></p>
<p>Our Apex Court held in Hakam Singh v. Gammon (India) Ltd., AIR 1971 SC 740, as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>“It is not open to the parties by agreement to confer by their agreement jurisdiction on a Court which it does not possess under the Code. But where two courts or more have under the Code of Civil Procedure jurisdiction to try a suit or proceeding an agreement between the parties that the dispute between them shall be tried in one of such Courts is not contrary to public policy. Such an agreement does not contravene s. 28 of the Contract Act.”</li></ul>
<p>In Seth Hiralal Patni vs Sri Kali Nath, 1962 AIR 199, the Supreme Court held as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>“The decision of the Privy Council in the case of Ledgard v. Bull, (1886) LR 13 IA 134, is an authority for the proposition that <span style="text-decoration:underline;">consent or waiver can cure defect of jurisdiction but cannot cure inherent lack of jurisdiction.</span> In that case, the suit had been instituted in the Court of the Subordinate Judge, who was incompetent to try it. By consent of’ the parties, the case was transferred to the Court of the, district Judge for convenience of trial. It was laid down by the Privy Council that as the Court in the suit had been originally instituted was entirely lacking in jurisdiction, in the sense that it was incompetent to try it, whatever happened subsequently was null and void because consent of parties could not operate to confer jurisdiction on a Court which was incompetent to try the suit. That decision has no relevance to a case like the present where there could be no question of inherent lack of jurisdiction in the sense that the Bombay High Court was incompetent to try a, suit of that kind. <span style="text-decoration:underline;">The objection to its territorial jurisdiction is one which does not go to the competence of the Court and can, therefore, be waived.</span> In the instant case, when the plaintiff obtained the leave of the, Bombay High Court on the original side, under el. 12 of the Letters Patent, the correctness of the procedure or of the order granting the leave could be. questioned by the defendant or the objection could be waived by him. When he agreed to refer the matter to arbitration through Court, he would be deemed to have waived his objection to the territorial jurisdiction of the Court, raised by him in his written statement. It is well settled that the <span style="text-decoration:underline;">objection as to local jurisdiction of a Court does not stand on the same footing as an objection to the competence of a Court to try a case.</span> <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Competence of a Court to try a case goes to the very root of the jurisdiction, and where it is lacking, it is a case of inherent lack of jurisdiction</span>. On the other hand, <span style="text-decoration:underline;">an objection as to the local jurisdiction of a Court can be waived </span>and this principle has been given a statutory recognition by ‘enactments like s. 21 of the Code of Civil Procedure. <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Having consented to have the controversy between the parties resolved by reference to arbitration through Court, the defendant deprived himself of the right to question the authority of the Court to refer the matter to arbitration </span>or of the arbitrator to render the award. It is clear, therefore, that the defendant is estopped from challenging the jurisdiction of the Bombay High Court to entertain the suit and to make the reference to the arbitrator. He is equally estopped from challenging the authority of the arbitrator to render the award.”</li></ul>
<p><strong><u>Availability of Alternative Forum – Objection be Taken at the Earliest</u>,</strong></p>
<p>It is held by our Apex Court Kiran Singh v. Chaman Paswan: AIR 1954 SC 340. as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>“The policy underlying sections 21 and 99 of the Civil Procedure Code and section 11 of the Suits Valuation Act is the same, namely, that when a case had been tried by a Court on the merits and judgment rendered, it should not be liable to be reversed purely on technical grounds, unless it had resulted in a failure of justice, and the policy of the Legislature has been to treat objections to jurisdiction both territorial and pecuniary as technical and not open to consideration by an appellate Court, unless there has been a <strong>prejudice</strong> on the merits.”(Quoted in: Bahrein Petroleum v. P.J. Pappu, AIR 1966 SC 634)</li></ul>
<p>It is held by our Apex Court in Ramesh Chand Ardawatiya v. Anil Panjwani, AIR 2003 SC 2508, as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>“Where there is a special tribunal conferred with jurisdiction or exclusive jurisdiction to try a particular class of cases even then the civil court can entertain a civil suit of that class on availability of a few grounds. An exclusion of jurisdiction of the civil court is not to be readily inferred. (See Dhulabhai v. State of M.P, (1968) 3 SCR 662) An objection as to the exclusion of the civil court‘s jurisdiction for availability of alternative forum should be taken before the trial court and at the earliest, failing which the higher court may refuse to entertain the plea in the absence of proof of prejudice.”</li></ul>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><mark class="has-inline-color has-primary-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">PART IV</mark></span></strong></p>
<p><u><strong>Inherent L</strong></u><strong><u>ack of Jurisdiction</u></strong></p>
<p>As shown above, defects on pecuniary and territorial jurisdiction are not so fatal as compared to inherent lack of jurisdiction or jurisdiction on the subject matter of the suit. The objections as to the first category has to be raised in the pleadings at the earliest opportunity. If it is not done the party concerned is loses his chance.</p>
<p><u>Inherent Lack of Jurisdiction or Jurisdiction on the Subject Matter</u></p>
<p>The objections to the second category (inherent lack of jurisdiction or jurisdiction on the subject matter) can be raised without pleading and at any stage of the suit or even in execution or collateral proceedings.</p>
<p>In view of Sec. 21 CPC (objection as to the place of suing shall be taken in the Court of first instance at the earliest possible opportunity) it is held in Hasham Abbas Sayyad v. Usman Abbas Sayyad, AIR 2007 SC 1077, as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>“We may, however hasten to add that a distinction must be made between a decree passed by a court which has no territorial or pecuniary jurisdiction in the light of Section 21 of the CPC; and a decree passed by a court having no jurisdiction in regard to the subject matter of the suit. Whereas in the former case, the appellate court may not interfere with the decree <strong><u>unless prejudice</u></strong> is shown, ordinarily the second category of the cases would be interfered with.”</li></ul>
<p>The third category in this line is the objection that can be raised in any stage, including appeal or revision, without pleading, but not in execution or collateral proceedings (eg. bar by limitation). Ittyavira Mathai v. Varkey Varkey, AIR 1964 SC 907; Bhawarlal Bhandari v. M/s. Universal Heavy Mechanical Lifting Enterprises, AIR 1999 SC 246.</p>
<p>It is held by our Apex Court in Kiran Singh v. Chaman Paswan, AIR 1954 SC 340. as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>“It is a fundamental principle well established that a decree passed by a Court without jurisdiction is a nullity, and that its invalidity could be set up whenever and wherever it is sought to be enforced or relied upon, even at the stage of execution and even in collateral proceedings. A defect of jurisdiction, whether it is pecuniary or territorial, or whether it is in respect of the subject-matter of the action, strikes at the very authority of the Court to pass any decree, and such a defect cannot be cured even by consent of parties.” (Referred to in : Foreshore Co-operative Housing Society Limited v. Praveen D. Desai (Dead) AIR 2015 SC 2006.)</li></ul>
<p><strong><u>Lack of ‘Subject-Matter-Jurisdiction</u></strong>‘</p>
<p>Decision on a Labour Dispute by a Civil Court and pronouncement on a civil matter by the Rent Controller are the common examples of lack of ‘subject-matter jurisdiction’.</p>
<p>Our Apex Court held in P. Dasa Muni Reddy v. P. Appa Rao, AIR 1974 SC 2089, that there will be no res judicata if the former suit was filed in a court where it had no jurisdiction over the subject matter. The Court held as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>“The appellant proved that the appellant made a mistake of fact in regard to the building, being outside the mischief of the Act. The appellant instituted the-suit before the Rent Controller in mistake about the underlying and fundamental fact that the building was outside the ambit of the Act. The Civil Court has jurisdiction in the subsequent suit which is the subject of this appeal. The appellant is not disentitled to any relief on the grounds of res judicata or estoppel or waiver. As one cannot confer jurisdiction by consent similarly one cannot by agreement waive exclusive jurisdiction of courts. The Civil Court and not the Rent Control possesses jurisdiction over the building in question.”</li></ul>
<p>In Chief Engineer Hydel Project v. Ravinder Nath, AIR 2008 SC 1315, it was held that the civil court had no jurisdiction to decide the dispute of termination of service of a workman as the labour Court alone had the jurisdiction with respect to the same. The Supreme Court held as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>“Once the original decree itself has been held to be without jurisdiction and hit by the doctrine of coram non judice, there would be no question of upholding the same merely on the ground that the objection to the jurisdiction was not taken at the initial, First Appellate or the Second Appellate stage. It must, therefore, be held that the civil court in this case had no jurisdiction to deal with the suit and resultantly the judgments of the Trial Court, First Appellate Court and the Second Appellate Court are liable to be set aside for that reason alone and the appeal is liable to be allowed.”</li></ul>

<p><strong><u>Where court has No Jurisdiction Over the</u> <u>Subject Matter, Order Will Be Nullity</u></strong></p>
<p>In Harshad Chiman Lal Modi v. DLF Universal Ltd., AIR 2005 SC 4446, it is held as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>“So far as territorial and pecuniary jurisdictions are concerned, objection to such jurisdiction has to be taken at the earliest possible opportunity and in any case at or before settlement of issues. The law is well settled on the point that if such objection is not taken at the earliest, it cannot be allowed to be taken at a subsequent stage. Jurisdiction as to subject matter, however, is totally distinct and stands on a different footing. Where a court has <span style="text-decoration:underline;">no jurisdiction over the <u>subject matter of the suit</u></span> by reason of any limitation imposed by statute, charter or commission, it cannot take up the cause or matter. An order passed by a court having no jurisdiction is nullity.”</li></ul>
<p><strong><u>Void Judgment: When No declaration needed</u></strong>. When a Judgment or Order (or any other transaction) is wholly without jurisdiction or ab initio void, it can be attacked at any time, in any court, either directly or collaterally.</p>

<p>There are instances where it is not permissible for a party to treat the <strong>judgment and order </strong>as null and void without getting it <strong>set aside </strong>from the competent court, such as:</p>

<p><strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Conclusion</span></strong></p>
<p>It is trite law that a decree passed by a Court totally <span style="text-decoration:underline;">without jurisdiction is a nullity</span>. The law on the point can be summarised as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>Lack of jurisdiction hits a Judgment or Order by, lack of jurisdiction: <ul><li>over the parties, or </li><li>as to territorial limit,</li><li>pecuniary limit or</li><li>the subject matter.</li></ul></li><li>Lack of Jurisdiction is also visited by:<ul><li> ‘lack of inherent power’ to enter the particular judgment, or</li><li> an order procured by fraud or collusion.</li></ul></li><li>It is not permissible to treat a Judgment or an Order<strong> </strong>of a Court/Authority as null and void without setting it aside or declared by the competent court.<ul><li>A judgment of nullity would operate erga omnes i.e. for and against everyone concerned if only it is so declared by the Court.</li><li>It is <strong>not </strong>permissible for any person to ignore the same merely because in his opinion the order is void. </li><li>Or, it cannot be determined by the parties. </li></ul></li><li>If only patent and latent invalidity, or inherent lack of jurisdiction/competence, then only such a declaration is permissible.</li><li>Where a decree is passed by a Court without jurisdiction was a nullity, its invalidity could not be corrected, even by the consent of the concerned parties. </li></ul>
<p>Though the principle that a decree passed by a Court <span style="text-decoration:underline;">without jurisdiction is a nullity</span> was applied strictly in earlier times, there is a slow change in the attitude of the courts as regards the rigidity to see the Orders and Judgments as without jurisdiction, inasmuch as the courts began to apply the doctrines of prejudice, acquiescence, patent and latent invalidity, etc, in this matter. </p>
