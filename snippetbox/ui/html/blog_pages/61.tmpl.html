<p><span style="text-decoration:underline">Introduction.</span></p>
<p>The law as to ‘protection of possession’ by courts in India can be summarised as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><mark class="has-inline-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#0518f9">Possession by itself is a <span style="text-decoration:underline">substantive right</span> recognised by law. It is heritable and transferable.</mark></li>

</ul>
<p><span style="text-decoration:underline"><strong>Two Essential Elements of Possession </strong></span></p>
<p>Sir Thomas Erkine Holland, in his treatise, ‘The Element of Jurisprudence’ pointed out that the concept of possession has two essential elements – <span style="text-decoration:underline">corpus and animus</span>. (Quoted in: Kanti Lal vs Smt. Shanti Devi, AIR 1997 Raj 230). </p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration:underline">‘Possession Follows Title’ and ‘Title Follows Possession’</span></strong></p>
<p>The legal principles, ‘Possession Follows Title’ and ‘Title Follows Possession’, are  Rules of Evidence. It is recognised in S. 110 and 114 of the Indian Evidence Act. These principles are applied in cases where there are no sufficient and independent evidence to prove possession or title, as the case may be. </p>
<p>Read Blog: <a href="https://indianlawlive.net/2021/11/14/does-possession-follows-title-when-title-follows-possession/"><strong>When ‘Possession Follows Title’; ‘Title Follows Possession’?</strong></a></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration:underline">Section 110 of the Evidence Act</span></strong></p>
<p>Section 110 of the Evidence Act, 1872, reads as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“110. <strong><span style="text-decoration:underline">Burden of proof as to ownership</span>.</strong>—<span style="text-decoration:underline">When the question is </span><span style="text-decoration:underline">whether any person is owner</span> of anything of which he is shown to be in possession, the burden of proving that he is not the owner is on the person who affirms that he is not the owner.”</li>
</ul>
<p>Section 110 deals with the <span style="text-decoration:underline">burden of proof as to</span> <span style="text-decoration:underline">ownership</span>. When a dispute arises as to whether a person in possession of anything is its owner, the burden of proving that he is not its owner is on the person who avers that he is not the owner.  Section 110 is based on the principle that <span style="text-decoration:underline">possession itself may raise</span> a <span style="text-decoration:underline">presumption of title</span>. This applies when the facts disclose no title in either of the disputants, and possession alone decides. That is,  presumption is invoked only <span style="text-decoration:underline">when the facts as to title are not known</span>.</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>M.  Siddiq   v. Mahant Suresh Das (Ayodhya Case), 2020-1 SCC 1;  </li>
<li>State of A.P. v. Star Bone Mill &amp; Fertiliser Company, (2013) 9 SCC 319; </li>
<li>Chief Conservator of Forests v. Collectors, AIR 2003 SC 1805<strong>)</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Apex Court, in M.  Siddiq   v. Mahant Suresh Das <strong>(Ayodhya Case)</strong>, relied on Nair Service Society v. Fr. KC Alexander, AIR 1968 SC 1165<strong>, </strong>wherein it was observed that when no title in either of the disputants, ‘possession alone decides’.</p>
<p><strong><u>Sec. 110 is Based</u> <span style="text-decoration:underline">on ‘O<span class="uppercase">wnership</span>‘; and NOT on ‘<span class="uppercase">Title</span>‘</span></strong></p>
<p>Under S. 110, ownership is presumed on the proof of possession. It ‘follows from well settled principle of law that normally, unless contrary is established, title always follows possession’ (Chuharmal v.  Commissioner of Income Tax, M P, AIR  1988 SC 1384; 1988 3 SCC 588).</p>
<p>Though Sec. 110 is, generally,  said to be based on the principle ‘Title Follows Possession’, what is decisively articulated in this section is ‘<span style="text-decoration:underline">ownership</span>‘; and not ‘<span style="text-decoration:underline">title</span>‘.  That is, in law, ownership alone can be presumed; and not title. Title is the legal and authoritative expression of ownership; or, it is the legal recognition of a right. </p>
<p>M.  Siddiq  v. Mahant Suresh Das (Ayodhya Case), 2020-1 SCC 1, lays down (paras 784 and 785) the following:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>For Section 110 to be attracted, there must be a dispute as to <span style="text-decoration:underline">ownership</span> of anything.</li>
<li>Section 110 deals with the burden of proof.</li>
<li>The ‘thing’ must be in possession of one individual.</li>
<li>That individual is presumed to be the owner (on the principle that ‘title follows possession’. That is, possession in and of itself may raise a presumption of title.)</li>
<li>Section 110 applies when the facts disclose <span style="text-decoration:underline">no title in either of the disputants</span> in which case, possession alone decides (because, presumption cannot be invoked when the facts are known).</li>
<li>The law casts the burden of disproving ownership on that individual in the person who affirms that the individual in possession is not the owner.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration:underline">Section 114 of the Evidence Act</span></strong></p>
<p>S. 114, Evidence Act, expressly permits the court to ‘presume the existence of any fact which it thinks likely to have happened, regard being had to the common course of natural events, human conduct and public and private business, in their relation to the facts of the particular case’. Therefore, by virtue of Sec. 114, both the  presumptions, on title and possession, can be invoked; that is,</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>(i) possession can be presumed on the basis of title (possession follows title), and </li>
<li>(ii) title/ownership can be presumed on the basis of possession (title follows possession).</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="text-decoration:underline"><strong>When ‘Possession Follows Title</strong>‘,<strong> Invoked</strong></span></p>
<p>In Jones v. Chopman, (1849) 2 Ex. 803: 18 LJ Ex. 456: 76 PR 794; Maule, J, expounded the doctrine ‘Possession Follows Title’ as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“If there are two persons in a field, each asserting that the field is his, and each doing some act in the assertion of the right of possession, and if the question is, which of these two is in actual possession, <span style="text-decoration:underline">I answer, the person who has the title is in actual possession</span> and the other person is a trespasser. In such a case who is in possession is to be determined by the fact of the title and having the same apparent actual possession; The question as to which of the two really is in possession is determined by the fact of the <span style="text-decoration:underline">possession; following the title</span>, that is by the law, which makes it follow the title.” (Mitra quoted it in “Law of Possession and Ownership of Property”, as pointed out in Indore Development Authority vs. Manoharlal, (2020) 8 SCC 129)</li>
</ul>
<p>In Indore Development Authority vs. Manoharlal, (2020) 8 SCC 129, Arun Misra, J. pointed out as to possession as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“247. The concept of possession is complex one. It comprises the right to possess and to exclude others, essential is animus possidendi. Possession depends upon the character of the thing which is possessed. <span style="text-decoration:underline">If the land is not capable of any use, mere non-user of it does not lead to the inference that the owner is not in possession</span>. The established principle is that the possession follows title. Possession comprises of the control over the property. The element of possession is the physical control or the power over the object and intention or will to exercise the power. Corpus and animus are both necessary and have to co-exist.”</li>
</ul>
<p>Arun Misra, J. held further:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“251. A <span style="text-decoration:underline">person with title is considered to be in actual possession</span>. The other person is a trespasser. The possession in law follows the right to possess as held in Kynoch Limited v. Rowlands, (1912) 1Ch 527. Ordinarily, the <span style="text-decoration:underline">owner of the property is presumed to be in possession</span> and presumption as to possession is in his favour.”</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">Injunction Suit- Need Not Venture on Title</span></strong></p>
<p>In Iqbal Basith v. N. Subbalakshmi, (2021) 2 SCC 718, the appellants were seeking the relief of <span style="text-decoration: underline">permanent injunction only</span>. Their title to the suit property was not disputed by the respondents. The two reports of the Pleader Commissioner also confirmed the possessory title of the appellants along with property tax registers and municipal tax receipts. <span style="text-decoration: underline">The appellants</span> had more than sufficiently <span style="text-decoration: underline">established their lawful possession</span> of the suit property. In this situation our Apex Court held as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“15. The conclusion by the courts below that the appellants had failed to establish title and therefore could not be said to be in lawful possession is therefore held to be perverse and unsustainable. Similarly, the conclusion that the <span style="text-decoration: underline">identity of the suit property was not established is also held to be perverse in view of letter dated 16.04.1956 from the municipality</span>, referred to herein above. The contention of the respondents feebly seeking to question the title of the appellants was rejected holding that they had nothing to do with the suit schedule property and that their conduct was questionable. Yet the <span style="text-decoration: underline">appellants were wrongly denied the relief of permanent injunction</span>. In our considered opinion the Trial Court and the High Court both posed unto themselves the <span style="text-decoration: underline">wrong</span> question <span style="text-decoration: underline">venturing to decide the title</span> of the appellants, and arrived at an erroneous conclusion.” </li>
</ul>
<p><strong><u>Settled Possession Vs. Rights of True Owner</u></strong></p>
<p>When the relief of injunction or possession sought for in a suit is negated, and the title of the defendant as the owner is upheld, can the defendant recover the property without instituting a (second) suit, i.e., otherwise than on “due process of law“?</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Earlier consistent view (See: Aarti v. Aruna Gautham 2015-1 RCR Civil – 160: SC) was that the true owner was not legally entitled to eject the trespasser by force (otherwise than on due process of law), especially when the trespasser is in settled possession.</li>
<li>Present view: In Prahladji Chenaji v. Maniben Jagmalbhai: 2022-2 RCR (Civil) 395; 2022 SCC OnLine SC 258 (Followed in: Kesar Bai v. Genda Lal, 2022-10 SCC 217) it is held that the ‘due process’ or ‘due course’ condition was satisfied the moment the rights of the parties were adjudicated upon (in the first round), and therefore the possession of the plaintiff is not lawful or ‘rightful‘.</li>
</ul>
<p>It is held in Prahladji Chenaji as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“Where once a suit is held not maintainable, no relief of injunction can be granted. Injunction may be granted even against the true owner of the property, only when the person seeking the relief is in <strong>lawful</strong> possession “</li>
<li>Note: Kesar Bai v. Genda Lal, 2022-10 SCC 217 (<strong>M.R. Shah</strong>, Sudhanshu Dhulia, JJ.) calls for reading along with Prahladji Chenaji v. Maniben Jagmalbhai: 2022-2 RCR (Civil) 395; 2022 SCC OnLine SC 258 (<strong>M.R. Shah</strong>, B.V. Nagarathna, JJ.).</li>

<p><strong><u>Even Rightful Owner</u></strong> <strong><u>to Take Recourse to law; He cannot take the law in his own hands</u></strong></p>
<p>In<strong> Rame Gowda v. M. Varadappa Naidu</strong>, (2004) 1 SCC 769, our Apex Court Court (<strong>R.C. Lahoti, </strong>B.N. Srikrishna, G.P. Mathur, JJ.) observed that the law will come to the aid of a person in peaceful and <strong>settled possession</strong> by injuncting even a <strong>rightful owner</strong>. It is held as under:­ </p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“8. It is thus clear that so far as the Indian law is concerned the person in peaceful possession is entitled to retain his possession and in order to protect such possession he may even use reasonable force to keep out a trespasser.</li>
<li>A rightful owner who has been wrongfully dispossessed of land may retake possession if he can do so peacefully and without the use of unreasonable force.</li>
<li>If the trespasser is in settled possession of the property belonging to the rightful owner, the rightful owner shall have to take recourse to law; he cannot take the law in his own hands and evict the trespasser or interfere with his possession. </li>
<li>The law will come to the aid of a person in peaceful and settled possession by injuncting even a rightful owner from using force or taking law in his own hands, and also by restoring him in possession even from the rightful owner (of course subject to the law of limitation), if the latter has dispossessed the prior possessor by use of force.</li>
<li>In the absence of proof of better title, possession or prior peaceful settled possession is itself evidence of title. Law presumes the possession to go with the title unless rebutted. The owner of any property may prevent even by using reasonable force a trespasser from an attempted trespass, when it is in the process of being committed, or is of a flimsy character, or recurring, intermittent, stray or casual in nature, or has just been committed, while the rightful owner did not have enough time to have recourse to law. In the last of the cases, the possession of the trespasser, just entered into would not be called as one acquiesced to by the true owner.” (quoted in: Subramanya Swamy Temple, Ratnagiri v. V. Kanna Gounder, 2009-3 SCC 306; Poona Ram v. Moti Ram, AIR 2019 SC 813)</li>
</ul>
<p>What is the settled possession or effective possession of a person without title which would entitle him to protect his possession even as against the true owner was made clear in Rame Gowda v. M. Varadappa Naidu, (2004) 1 SCC 769. It reads as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“9. …The “settled possession” must be (i) effective, (ii) undisturbed, and (iii) to the knowledge of the owner or without any attempt at concealment by the trespasser. The phrase “settled possession” does not carry any special charm or magic in it; nor is it a ritualistic formula which can be confined in a straitjacket. An occupation of the property by a person as an agent or a servant acting at the instance of the owner will not amount to actual physical possession.” (quoted in Samarpan Varishtha Jan Parisar vs Rajendra Prasad Agarwal, AIR 2022 SC 2209)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><u>Even the Rightful Owner cannot Eject a Trespasser with Force</u></strong></p>
<p>In Karthiyayani Amma v. Govindan, AIR 1980 Ker 224, the Kerala High Court considered the question whether the rightful owner can eject a trespasser in possession with force; and whether a person in illegal possession could sustain a suit for injunction against the true owner, from forcibly dispossessing him from the property.  It was held as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“The ultimate position, therefore, reduces itself to this:</li>
<li>Can a person in possession without title sustain a suit for injunction against the rightful owner if he proves possession? Yes.</li>
<li>In this case, plaintiff is found to in be possession. On the finding, he should be granted the injunction prayed for. A person in possession can be evicted only in due process of law. Even the rightful owner cannot eject him with force. If he cannot be evicted with force, he continues to be in possession and he can resist invasion of his possession by everyone including the rightful owner. If the rightful owner threatens his peaceful possession, he can approach Courts of Law and pray for the equitable relief of injunction to protect his possession”. (Followed in: Aiysumma v. Mariyamma, 1994-2 CIVCC 52, 1994-1 KerLT 570. )</li>
</ul>
<p>It is pointed out in Suresh v. Ashok Girdharilal Chandak, 2016-1 MHLJ 171 that ‘bearing in mind the basic principle of law in civil jurisprudence that even a trespasser cannot be evicted without following due process of law and no one can be allowed to take law into his own hands to recover possession of the property without following due process of law and without proving title to the immovable property in possession of a person holding actual physical possession thereof’.</p>
<p><strong><u>Divergent Views</u></strong></p>
<p>It is observed by our Apex Court, in Prataprai N. Kothari v. John Braganza, AIR 1999 SC 1666, as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“It is quite obvious that the learned single Judge had not taken note of the principle of possessory title or the principle of law that a person who has been in long continuous possession can protect the same by seeking an injunction against any person in the world other than the <strong>true owner</strong>. It is also well settled that even the owner of the property can get back his possession only by resorting to <strong>due process of law</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Divergent Views are set out in Sopan Sukhdeo Sable v. Assistant Charity Commissioner, AIR 2004 SC 1801 also. They are the following:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>first, a person in <strong>settled possession</strong> cannot be disposed by the owner except by recourse of law</li>
<li>second, a trespasser in possession cannotnot seek injunction against the <strong>true owner</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>In this case, a forceful postulation is posed-</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>A trespasser ousted can seek restoration of possession under Section 6 of the Specific Relief Act, 1963 (even) against the true owner. If so, can’t the trespasser seek injunction as to possession, against the true owner?</li>
</ul>
<p>In Sopan Sukhdeo Sable v. Assistant Charity Commissioner, AIR 2004 SC 1801, the appellants were the plaintiffs whose suit was rejected in terms of Order VII, Rule 11 of the Code of Civil Procedure. It is held in this decision as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“24. There are two different sets of principles which have to be borne in mind regarding course to be adopted in case of forcible dispossession. Taking up the first aspect, it is true that where a person is in <strong><u>settled possession</u></strong> of property, even on the assumption that he has no right to remain in property, he cannot be disposed by the owner except by recourse of law. This principle is laid down in Section 6 of the Specific Relief Act, 1963. That Section says that if any person is dispossession without his consent from immovable property otherwise than in due course of law, he or any person claiming through him may, by suit, recover possession thereof, notwithstanding any other title that may be set up in such suit. That a person without title but in “settled” possession – as against mere fugitive possession – can get back possession if forcibly dispossessed or rather, if dispossessed otherwise than by due process of law, has been laid down in several cases. It was so held by this Court in<ul><li>Yashwant Singh v. Jagdish Singh, AIR 1968 SC 620,</li></ul><ul><li>Krishna Ram Mohate v. Mrs. Shobha Venkata Rao, (1989) 4 SCC 131 at p. 136;</li></ul><ul><li>Ram Rattan v. State of UP, (1977) 1 SCC 188, and</li></ul>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>State of UP v. Maharaja Dharmender Prasad Singh, (1989) 2 SCC 505.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The leading decision quoted in these rulings is the decision of the Bombay High Court in</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>K. K. Verma vs. Union of India, AIR 1954 Bom 358.</li>
<li>25. Now the other aspect of the matter needs to be noted. Assuming a trespasser ousted can seek restoration of possession under Section 6 of the Specific Relief Act, 1963 can the trespasser seek injunction against the true owner<strong>?</strong></li>
<li>This question does not entirely depend upon Section 6 of the Specific Relief Act, but mainly depends upon certain general principles applicable to the law of injunctions and as to the scope of the exercise of discretion while granting injunction.</li>
<li>In Mahadeo Savlaram Sheike vs. Pune Municipal Corporation, (1995) 3 SCC 33, it was held, after referring to Woodrofe on “Law relating to injunction: L. C. Goyal Law of injunctions:
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>David Bean Injunction Jayce on Injunctions and other leading Articles on the subject that the appellant who was a trespasser in possession could not seek injunction against the true owner.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>In that context this Court quoted Shiv Kumar Chadha vs. MCD (1993) 3 SCC 161 wherein it was observed that injunction is discretionary and that:
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“Judicial proceedings cannot be used to protect or to perpetuate a wrong committed by a person who approaches the Court.”</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>26. Reference was also made to Dalpat Kumar vs. Prahlad Singh (1992) 1 SCC 719 in regard to the meaning of the words prima facie case and balance of convenience and observed in Mahadeos case (supra) that:
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“It is settled law that no injunction could be granted against the owner at the instance of a person in unlawful possession.”</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>27. The question of forcible possession as claimed is also a matter which can be pressed into service by the parties before the trial Court and if raised the Court shall deal with it considering its relevance to the suit and accept it or otherwise reject the plea in accordance with law.

<p>Kesar Bai v. Genda Lal, 2022-10 SCC 217, arose from a suit seeking declaration of ownership and permanent injunction. The findings of the High Court were the following:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>the plea of ownership claimed by the plaintiff based on a sale deed and the plea of adverse possession were contrary to each other;</li>
<li>the plaintiffs could not have been permitted to take both the pleas at the same time;</li>
<li>but, in view of the fact that the plaintiff was in possession of the suit land since the execution of the said sale deed, the plaintiff was entitled for injunction on the basis of his possession.</li>
</ul>
<p>Setting aside the High Court judgment the Apex Court held as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“The possession/alleged possession of the plaintiffs could not have been protected by passing a decree of permanent injunction in favour of the plaintiffs”.</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="text-decoration:underline"><strong>Person in possession can use Reasonable Force to keep out a Trespasser</strong></span></p>
<p>Though in Rame Gowda v. M. Varadappa Naidu, (2004) 1 SCC 769, our Apex Court  Court observed that the rightful owner shall have to take recourse to law if the trespasser is in settled possession of the property belonging to the rightful owner, and the owner cannot take the law in his own hands and evict the trespasser, it is pointed out as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“8. It is thus clear that so far as the Indian law is concerned the <span style="text-decoration:underline">person in peaceful possession is entitled to retain his possession</span> and in order <span style="text-decoration:underline">to protect such possession he may even use <strong>reasonable for</strong>ce to keep out a trespasser</span>. </li>
<li>A rightful owner who has been <span style="text-decoration:underline">wrongfully dispossessed of land may retake possession</span> <span style="text-decoration:underline">if he can do so <strong>peacefully</strong></span> and without the use of unreasonable force.”  </li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration:underline">Law Recognises Efficacy of Possession in Section 6 of the Specific Relief Act</span></strong></p>
<p>Section 6 of the Specific Relief Act allows one to file a suit for recovery of property, on the strength of his prior possession, if he had lost his possession within 6 months of the suit. In such a case, he need not prove his title; and he can succeed on establishing that he has been dispossessed otherwise than in accordance with law within six months. </p>
<p>Sec. 6 of the Specific Relief Act, 1963 reads as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>6. <span style="text-decoration:underline">Suit by person dispossessed of immovable property.</span></li>
<li>(1) If any person is <span style="text-decoration:underline">dispossessed without his consent of immovable property otherwise than in due course of law,</span> he or any person claiming through him may, by suit, recover possession thereof, notwithstanding any other title that may be set up in such suit.</li>

</ul>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">If </span></strong><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Title not Perfected by Adver. Posn,  Can one eject a Trespasser After 6 Months</strong></span></p>
<p>High Courts differ, as pointed out in Kuttan Narayanan v. Thomman Mathayi, AIR 1966 Ker 179.</p>
<p>Now it is settled that if one fails to exercise his option by filing a suit under Section 6 of the Specific Relief Act within six months, he is at liberty to file a suit to recover his possession (with or without declaration) by a regular suit for recovery of possession. It can be based on title or on his possession in assumed or presumed character of ownership (even if title not perfected by doctrine of adverse possession) on the principle that  possession is good title against all the world but the rightful owner. See: Kuttan Narayanan v. Thomman Mathayi, AIR 1966 Ker 179; Kanti Lal v.  Smt. Shanti Devi, AIR 1997 Raj 230. (Refer End-Note also)</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration:underline">‘Possession is good against all but the True Owner’</span><span style="text-decoration:underline"> &amp; Sec. 6 of the Sp. Relief Act</span></strong></p>
<p>The principle ‘Possession is Good against all but the True Owner’ is declared in Parry v. Clissold, (1907) AC 73. In this decision it was also pointed out that if the rightful owner did not come forward and assert his title within the period of limitation, his right would be extinguished and the possessory owner acquires an absolute title. </p>
<p>The Supreme Court of India while accepting this principle in <strong>Nair Service Society Ltd. vs. K.C. Alexander, AIR 1968 SC 1165</strong>, pointed out that the <span style="text-decoration:underline">law in India allows a plaintiff to maintain a possessory suit under Sec. 9 (preset Sec. 6) of the Specific Relief Act</span>. Such a suit can be filed against a title holder, if he had dispossessed the plaintiff ‘otherwise than in due course of law’.</p>
<p>In Nair Service Society Ltd. vs. K.C. Alexander, AIR 1968 SC 1165, it is observed as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“17. … To express our meaning we may begin by reading <span style="text-decoration:underline">1907 AC 73 (Perry V. Clissold)</span>, to discover if the principle that <span style="text-decoration:underline">possession is good against all but the <strong>true owner</strong></span> has in any way been departed from. </li>
<li>1907 AC 73 reaffirmed the principle by stating quite clearly:
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“It cannot be disputed that a <span style="text-decoration:underline">person in possession</span> of land in the assumed character of owner and exercising peaceably the ordinary rights of ownership has a perfectly <span style="text-decoration:underline">good title against all the world but the rightful owner</span>. And if the rightful owner does not come forward and assert his title by the process of law within the period prescribed by the provisions of the statute of Limitation applicable to the case, his right is for ever extinguished and the possessory owner acquires an absolute title.”</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Therefore, the plaintiff who was peaceably in possession was entitled to remain in possession and only the State could evict him. The action of the Society was a violent invasion of his possession and <span style="text-decoration:underline">in the law as it stands in India the plaintiff could maintain a possessory suit under the provisions of the Specific Relief Act</span> in which title would be immaterial or a suit for possession within 12 years in which the question of title could be raised.”</li>
</ul>
<p>In Poona Ram v. Moti Ram, AIR 2019 SC 813, our Apex Court explained the principle ‘possession is a good title of right against any one who cannot show a better’ as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“9. The law in India, as it has developed, accords with jurisprudential thought as propounded by luminaries like Salmond. Salmond on Jurisprudence  states:­
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“These two concepts of ownership and possession, therefore, may be used to distinguish between the de facto possessor of an object and its de jure owner, between the man who actually has it and the man who ought to have it. They serve also to contract the position of one whose rights are ultimate, permanent and residual with that of one whose rights are only of a temporary nature.</li>
<li>x x x x x </li>
<li>In English law possession is a good title of right against any one who cannot show a better. <span style="text-decoration:underline">A wrongful possessor has the rights of an owner with respect to all persons except earlier possessors and except the true owner himself.</span> Many other legal systems, however, go much further than this, and treat possession as a provisional or temporary title even against the true owner himself. Even a wrongdoer, who is deprived of his possession, can recover it from any person whatever, simply on the ground of his possession. Even the true owner, who takes his own, may be forced in this way to  restore it to the wrongdoer, and will not be permitted to set up his own superior title to it. He must first give up possession, and then proceed in due course of law for the recovery of the thing on the ground of his ownership. The intention of the law is that every possessor shall be entitled to retain and recover his possession, until deprived of it by a judgment according to law.</li>
<li>Legal remedies thus appointed for the protection of possession even against ownership are called possessory, while those available for the protection of ownership itself may be distinguished as proprietary. In the modern and medieval civil law the distinction is expressed by the contrasted terms petitorium (a proprietary suit) and possessorium (a possessory suit).”</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>10. As far back as 1924, in the case of Midnapur Zamindary Co. Ltd. v. Naresh Narayan Roy, AIR 1924 PC 144, the learned Judge observed that in India, persons are not permitted to take forcible possession; they must obtain such possession as they are entitled to through a court. Later, in the case of <span style="text-decoration:underline">Nair Service Society Ltd. v. K.C. Alexander</span>, AIR 1968 SC 1165, this Court ruled that <span style="text-decoration:underline">when the facts disclose no title in either party, possession alone decides</span>. It was further held that if Section 9 of the Specific Relief Act, 1877 (corresponding to the present Section6) is employed, the plaintiff need not prove title and the title of the defendant does not avail him. When, however, the period of six months has passed, questions of title can be raised by the defendant, and if he does so the plaintiff must establish a better title or fail. In other words, such a right is only restricted to possession in a suit under Section 9 of the Specific Relief Act (corresponding to the present Section 6) but does not bar a suit on prior possession within 12 years from the date of dispossession, and title need not be proved unless the defendant can provide one.</li>
<li>11. It was also observed by this Court in Nair Service Society Ltd. (supra) that a person in possession of land in assumed character of owner and exercising peaceably the ordinary rights of ownership has a <span style="text-decoration:underline">perfectly good title against the entire world except the rightful owner</span>. <span style="text-decoration:underline">In such a case, the defendant must show </span>in himself or his predecessor a <span style="text-decoration:underline">valid legal title and probably a possession prior to the plaintiff’s</span>, and thus be able to raise a presumption prior in time.”</li>

<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">Should the Defendant-Rightful-Owner Approach the Court Again For Recovery?</span></strong></p>
<p>Before Kesar Bai v. Genda Lal, our Apex Court held in <strong>Padhiyar Prahladji Chenaji v. Maniben Jagmalbhai</strong>, 2022 SCC OnLine SC 258 (<strong>M.R. Shah</strong>, B.V. Nagarathna, JJ.) to the following effect (see ‘End Notes’ below):</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>The plaintiff is not entitled to any injunction and/or protect his possession against the rightful owner, more particularly, when he fails to get the declaratory relief with respect to the title.</li>
<li>In a suit for permanent injunction to restrain the defendant from interfering with the plaintiff’s possession, the <mark>only thing the plaintiff will have to establish is that as on the date of the suit, he was in lawful possession o</mark>f the suit property and the defendant has tried to interfere or disturb his possession</li>
<li>the plaintiff, who has failed to get any declaratory relief on title cannot be said to be in “lawful possession”. Only when the person seeking the relief is <mark>in lawful possession </mark>and enjoyment of the property, he is legally entitled to be in possession, and not to disposes him, except in due process of law.</li>
<li>The contention of the plaintiff that even if the plaintiff failed to get the declaratory relief and the suit is dismissed, once the plaintiff is found to be in possession, her possession cannot be disturbed except in <strong><u>due process of law</u></strong> and the only remedy available to the defendant would be “to file a substantive suit to get back the possession is noticed only to be rejected outright”<strong>.</strong></li>
<li>In <strong>Maria Margarida Sequeira Fernandes Vs. Erasmo Jack de Sequeira, (2012) 5 SCC 370,</strong> it was held that the ‘due process’ or ‘due course’ condition was satisfied the moment the rights of the parties were adjudicated upon by a court of competent jurisdiction, and that it did not matter who brought the action to court.</li>
<li>In Maria Margarida Sequeira Fernandes Vs. Erasmo Jack de Sequeira, the Court has approved the following findings of the High Court of Delhi in Thomas Cook (India) Ltd. Vs. Hotel Imperial (2006) 88 DRJ 545:
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“In this context, when a party approaches a court seeking a protective remedy such as an injunction and it fails in setting up a good case, <mark>can it then say that the other party must now institute an action in a court of law for enforcing his rights</mark> i.e. for taking back something from the first party who holds it unlawfully, and, till such time, the court hearing the injunction action must grant an injunction anyway? <mark>I would think not</mark>.”</li>

<p><strong><u>No Res Judicata on a Finding on Title, in an Injunction Suit</u></strong></p>
<p>In Sulochana Amma Vs. Narayanan Nair [(1994) 2 SCC 14] it is observed as under:</p>
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p></p>
<cite><strong>“The decision in earlier case on the issue between the same parties or persons under whom they claim title or litigating under the same title, it operates as a res-judicata. A plea decided even in a suit for injunction touching title between the same parties, would operate as res-judicata. It is a settled law that in a Suit for injunction when title is in issue, for the purpose of granting injunction, the issue directly and substantially arises in that suit between the parties when the same is put in issue in a later suit based on title between the same parties or their privies in a subsequent suit, the decree in injunction suit equally operates as a res-judicata.”</strong></cite></blockquote>
<p>Anathula Sudhakar Vs. P. Buchi Reddy, AIR 2008 SC 2033, the Supreme Court held that where the issue of title involves complicated or complex questions of fact and law, or where court feels that parties had not proceeded on the basis that title was at issue, the court should not decide the issue of title in a suit for injunction. It is clear that findings of title in such suits are redundant so far as res judicata is concerned, The Court proceeded to hold as under:</p>
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p></p>
<cite><strong>“Where there are necessary pleadings regarding title, and appropriate issue relating to title on which parties lead evidence, if the matter involved is simple and straight-forward, the court may decide upon the issue regarding title, even in a suit for injunction. But such cases, are the exception to the normal rule that question of title will not be decided in suits for injunction. But persons having clear title and possession suing for injunction, should not be driven to the costlier and more cumbersome remedy of a suit for declaration, merely because some meddler veraciously or wrongfully makes a claim or tries to encroach upon his property. The court should use its discretion carefully to identify cases where it will enquire into title and cases where it will refer to plaintiff to a more comprehensive declaratory suit, depending upon the facts of the case.”</strong></cite></blockquote>

<p><span style="text-decoration:underline"><strong>M</strong></span><strong><span style="text-decoration:underline">utation will not confer ‘title’</span><span style="text-decoration:underline">; I</span><span style="text-decoration:underline">t merely raises a Presumption on Possession</span></strong></p>
<p>It is a settled proposition of law (i) that the mutation entry in revenue documents will not confer any right, title or interest in favour of any person and (ii) that the mutation in the revenue record is only for the fiscal purpose. After pointing out these legal propositions it is observed in <strong>Jitendra Singh vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh, 2021 SCC OnLine SC 802</strong>, as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“6. Right from 1997, the law is very clear. In the case of Balwant Singh v. Daulat Singh (D) By Lrs., reported in (1997) 7 SCC 137 , this Court had an occasion to consider the effect of mutation and it is observed and held that mutation of property in <span style="text-decoration:underline">revenue records neither creates nor extinguishes title</span> to the property nor has it any presumptive value on title. Such entries are relevant only for the purpose of collecting land revenue. Similar view has been expressed in the series of decisions thereafter. </li>
<li>6.1 In the case of Suraj Bhan v. Financial Commissioner, (2007) 6 SCC 186 , it is observed and held by this Court that an entry in <span style="text-decoration:underline">revenue records does not confer title</span> on a person whose name appears in record-of-rights. Entries in the revenue records or jamabandi have <span style="text-decoration:underline">only “fiscal purpose”</span>, i.e., payment of land revenue, and <span style="text-decoration:underline">no ownership is conferred on the basis of such entries</span>. It is further observed that so far as the t<span style="text-decoration:underline">itle of the property</span> is concerned, it can <span style="text-decoration:underline">only be decided by a competent civil court.</span> Similar view has been expressed in the cases of:
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li> Suman Verma v. Union of India, (2004) 12 SCC 58; Faqruddin v. Tajuddin (2008) 8 SCC 12; </li>
<li>Rajinder Singh v. State of J&amp;K, (2008) 9 SCC 368; </li>

<li>Prahlad Pradhan v. Sonu Kumhar, (2019) 10 SCC 259; and </li>
<li>Ajit Kaur v. Darshan Singh, (2019) 13 SCC 70.”</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>As pointed out above, it is observed by the Apex Court in <strong>State of AP v. Star Bone Mill &amp; Fertiliser Company, (2013) 9 SCC 319 </strong>that a <span style="text-decoration:underline">revenue record</span> is not a document of title; it merely <span style="text-decoration:underline">raises a presumption in regard to possession</span> (Quoted in M.  Siddiq   v. Mahant Suresh Das, 2020-1 SCC 1). The argument as to ownership based upon entries in the revenue records had been negated in Prahlad Pradhan  v. Sonu Kumhar,<strong><em> </em></strong>(2019) 10 SCC 259.  It was held that the revenue record does not confer title to the property nor do they have any presumptive value on the title. (Quoted in Prabhagiya Van Adhikari Awadh Van Prabhag v. Arun Kumar Bhardwaj (SC): 2021)</p>
<p><strong><u>Revenue Records Do Not Confer or Lose Title</u></strong></p>
<p>The Supreme Court in  Smt. Bhimabai Mahadeo Kambekar v. Arthur Import and Export Company (2019) and Commissioner, Bruhath Bangalore Mahanagra Palike vs Faraulla Khan (2021)<em><strong> </strong></em>observed that mutation in revenue records <span style="text-decoration:underline">will not confer or lose title</span>. In this case the court relied on:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Sawarni  Vs. Inder Kaur, (1996) 6 SCC 223, </li>
<li>Balwant Singh Vs. Daulat Singh,  (1997) 7 SCC 137 and</li>
<li>Narasamma  Vs. State of Karnataka, (2009) 5 SCC 591).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration:underline">Settled Possession and Established Possession</span> </strong></p>
<p>In A. Subramanian v. R. Pannerselvam, AIR 2021 SC 821, the Supreme Court held that even a trespasser, who is in established possession of the property could obtain injunction. But, it was cautioned that  the matter would be different, if the plaintiff himself elaborated in the plaint about <span style="text-decoration:underline">title dispute and fails to make a prayer for declaration of title</span> along with injunction relief. </p>
<p>In Poona Ram v. Moti Ram, AIR 2019 SC 813, it was pointed out in a case where there was no document to prove settled possession that ‘merely on doubtful material and cursory evidence, it cannot be held that the plaintiff was ever in possession of the property, and that too in settled possession’. It held further as under:</p>

The crux of the matter is that a person who asserts possessory title over a particular property will have to show that he is under <span style="text-decoration:underline">settled or established possession</span> of the said property. But merely <span style="text-decoration:underline">stray or intermittent acts of trespass do not give such a right</span> against the true owner.

Settled possession must be <span style="text-decoration:underline">(i) effective,(ii) undisturbed, and (iii) to the knowledge of the owner</span> or without any attempt at concealment by the trespasser. There <span style="text-decoration:underline">cannot be a straitjacket formula </span>to determine settled possession. Occupation of a property by a person as an agent or a servant acting at the instance of the owner will not amount to actual legal possession. The possession should contain an element of animus possidendi. The nature of possession of the trespasser is to be decided based on the facts and circumstances of each case.”</li>

<p><strong>Dorab Cawasji Warden v. Coomi Sorab Warden</strong>,  AIR  1990 SC 867 : (1990) 2 SCC 117, is the laudable decision on interim mandatory injunction. It is laid down in this decision that interlocutory mandatory injunctions are granted to:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>(i)  preserve or restore the <span style="text-decoration:underline">status quo ante, of the last non-contested status</span> which preceded the pending controversy, or</li>

<li>(iii) the restoration of that which was <span style="text-decoration:underline">wrongfully taken</span> from the party complaining.</li>
</ul>
<p>It is also pointed out that the court would consider the prospect of granting of a mandatory injunction finally, after trial; and delineated that a fresh state of affairs cannot be allowed to be created by the grant of such an injunction.</p>

<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“It is quite obvious that the learned single Judge had not taken note of the principle of possessory title or the principle of law that a person who has been in long continuous possession can protect the same by seeking an injunction against any person in the world other than the true owner.

<p>In Ghanshyam v. Yogendra Rathi, AIR 2023 SC 2754, 2023-7 SCC 361, the Supreme Court allowed the plaintiff (purchaser in an agreement for sale) to recover property from the defendant/title-holder (true-owner). It was on two, main, grounds:  </p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>First, the plaintiff/purchaser was having <strong><u>settled-possessory- title,</u></strong> in part performance under Sec. 53A of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882</li>

<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“270. The decision in Velaxan Kumar (supra) cannot be said to be laying down the law correctly. The Court considered the photographs also to hold that the possession was not taken. <strong>Photographs cannot evidence as to whether possession was taken or not</strong>. Drawing of a Panchnama is an accepted mode of taking possession. Even after re-entry, a photograph can be taken; equally, it taken be taken after committing trespass. Such documents cannot prevail over the established mode of proving whether possession is taken, of lands. <span style="text-decoration: underline">Photographs can be of little use, much less can they be a proof of possession.</span> A person may re-enter for a short period or only to have photograph. That would not impinge adversely on the proceedings of taking possession by drawing Panchnama, which has been a rarely recognised and settled mode of taking possession.</li>
<li>271. In the decision in Raghbir Singh Sehrawat v. State of Haryana, (2012) 1 SCC 792 the observation made was that it is not possible to take the possession of entire land in a day on which the award was declared, cannot be accepted as laying down the law correctly and same is contrary to a large number of precedents. The decision in Narmada Bachao Andolan v. State of M.P. (2011) 7 SCC 639, is confined to particular facts of the case. The Commissioner was appointed to find out possession on the spot. DVDs and CDs were seen to hold that the landowners were in possession. The District Judge, Indore, recorded the statements of the tenure-holder. <span style="text-decoration: underline">We do not approve the method of determining the possession by appointment of Commissioner or by DVDs and CDs as an acceptable mode of proving taking of possession.</span> The drawing of Panchnama contemporaneously is sufficient and <strong>it is not open to a court Commissioner to determine the factum of possession within the purview of Order XXVII, Rule 9 CPC. </strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">Whether possession has been taken, or not, is not a matter that a court appointed Commissioner cannot opine.</span> However, drawing of Panchnama by itself is enough and is  a proof of the fact that possession has been taken.”</li>

<p>Kerala High Court held in Thomas VY@ Sajimon v. Joseph VY, ILR 2020-3 Ker446,  2020-3 Ker LJ  574, 2020-3 KHC 613, as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“15. In a suit for permanent prohibitory injunction, the burden is entirely on the plaintiff to bring convincing evidence to show his possession over the plaint schedule property and for so doing, it is not permissible for the plaintiff to invoke Order 26 Rule 9 CPC, which is intended for a different purpose. In a matter relating to the investigation into the disputed question of fact of <strong><u>possession</u></strong>, the power of appointment of Commissioner for local investigation cannot be exercised by the Court to assist the party to collect evidence, where the party can collect evidence by itself. If a party claims that, that party is in possession of the disputed property and if the other party denies the same by filing the written statement, the disputed fact can be adjudicated by the Court after framing of issues and recording the evidence of the parties. So many articles may be found in the building at the time of local inspection by the Commissioner. Even clothes and other articles may be found in the building. The Commissioner has to just make an inventory of the items found in the building. <span style="text-decoration: underline">The Commissioner cannot report about the ownership of the articles found in the premises, </span>as the said aspect is a matter for evidence. If at all the Commissioner makes any such report, the Court shall not accept the report, even for primary satisfaction without any other convincing material. If the Advocate Commission is deputed for the purpose of ascertaining the possession of the party over the property, the said aspect can be done only after gathering information from the people in the locality, which amounts to fishing out the evidence or gathering of evidence and hence the same is only hearsay information. The party can even otherwise examine the persons, with whom the Commissioner makes enquiry, before the Court to prove the possession of the person over the property in question. The fishing out of information is to make a local enquiry collecting hearsay materials from the persons gathered there or the like, which is different from collection of materials which he finds at the scene. That apart, if that task is left to be decided by the Advocate Commissioner, any fraudulent litigant can create evidence and with the assistance of the Commissioner, he will be able to prove that he is in possession of the property, which is not the purpose for which Order 26 was enacted. <span style="text-decoration: underline">Therefore, it is always advisable not to appoint an Advocate Commissioner, as in the present case, to find out the possession</span> of the property, which has to be decided only from oral and documentary evidence to be adduced by the parties. The High Court of Madras in Mr. D. Kuttiyappan v. Meenakshiammal Polytechnic Unit, (2005) 4 MLJ 592, held that the Advocate Commissioner cannot be appointed to note down the factum of possession or the enjoyment . I respectfully agree with the view of the High Court of Madras in D. Kuttiyappan (Supra). Thus, it is settled law that the power of appointment of Commissioner for local investigation cannot be exercised by the Court to enable any party to collect evidence through the Commissioner to prove the factum of possession or enjoyment. This being the situation, the argument of the learned Counsel for the defendant that the report of the Commissioner would show the possession of the defendant in the plaint schedule property cannot be accepted even for the prima facie satisfaction of the Court.”</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration:underline">Adverse Possession –</span></strong> <strong><u>Present view</u> –</strong> Give prominence to overt and adverse acts of trespasser. </p>
<p>Following are the important decisions to see the present view on adverse possession:</p>
<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li>Karnataka Board of Wakaf v. Govt of India – AIR 2004 SC 2096</li>
<li>T. Anjanappa v. Somalingappa [(2006) 7 SCC 570]</li>
<li>PT Munichikkanna Reddy v. Revamma, AIR 2007 SC 1753</li>
<li>Ravinder Kaur Grewal v. Manjit Kaur<strong> </strong>AIR 2019 SC 3827: (2019) 8 SCC 729</li>
</ol>
<p>PT Munichikkanna Reddy v. Revamma, AIR 2007 SC 1753, is the latest decision of the Supreme Court that discussed various views on adverse possession. It is observed in this decision as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“Adverse possession in one sense is based on the theory or presumption that the owner has abandoned the property to the adverse possessor on the acquiescence of the owner to the hostile acts and claims of the person in possession. It follows that sound qualities of a typical adverse possession lie in it being open, continuous and hostile.”</li>
<li>“<em>Thus, there must be <strong>intention to dispossess</strong>. And it needs to be <strong>open</strong> and <strong>hostile enough</strong> to bring the same <strong>to the knowledge</strong> and plaintiff has an<strong> opportunity to object</strong>. </em>“</li>
</ul>
<p>U.N. Mitra, in the “Law of Limitation and Prescription” (Tagore Law Lectures – 12th Edition, Vol.2, Page 1430) it is stated as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“A squatter is one who settles on land without title or with a view to acquiring title. He is a person who settles or locate on land enclosed or unenclosed with no bona fide claim or colour of title and without consent of the owner. He is merely an intruder and no matter how long he may continue there, no right in law vests in him. A squatter who does not set up a claim of right cannot plead adverse possession. No length of squatting possession would operate as a good or valid defence in a suit for possession by the true owner. A mere squatter or intruder who does not deny the title of the true owner or set up any right in himself cannot claim to be in adverse possession. ………” (Quoted in: K.J. Abraham v. Mrs. Mariamma Itty, ILR 2016-3 Ker 98)</li>
</ul>
<p>In a nutshell, adverse possession arises from:</p>
<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li>acquiescence of the owner to the hostile acts; and</li>
<li>hostile acts of the trespasser.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong><u>Article 65 of Limitation Act, 1963: Major Changes in Law of Adverse Possession</u></strong></p>
<p>Articles 65 of the Limitation Act, 1963 brought-in  <strong><em><u>complete change</u></em></strong> insofar as the onus of proof is concerned (from the earlier law of 1908): The new provision casted onus on the trespasser to prove claims of title by ‘adverse’ possession. Adverse possession arises, under Article 65 of Limitation Act, 1963, only<strong> ‘by the positive and hostile acts’ </strong>of the trespasser; that is, mere possession is not sufficient, but, it must be ‘<strong>adverse</strong>’ to the true owner.</p>
<p>Article 65 of Limitation Act reads as under:</p>
<figure class="wp-block-table is-style-regular"><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>65.</strong> For possession of immovable property or any interest therein based on title.</td><td><em><u>12 years</u></em></td><td>When the possession of Defendant <strong><em>becomes</em></strong><br/><strong><em>adverse</em></strong><em> to the plaintiff</em>.</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>
<p>In T. Anjanappa v. Somalingappa, (2006) 7 SCC 570, it is observed <em>that the possession must be open and <strong>hostile enough</strong> to be capable of being known by the parties interested in the property, though it is not necessary that there should be evidence of the adverse possessor actually informing the real owner of the former’s hostile action</em></p>
<p>Our Apex Court held as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“The concept of adverse possession contemplates a hostile possession i.e., a possession which is expressly or impliedly in denial of the title of the true owner. Possession to be adverse must be possession by a person who does not acknowledge the other’s rights but denies them. The principle of law is firmly established that a person who bases his title on adverse possession must show by clear and unequivocal evidence that his possession was hostile to the real owner and amounted to denial of his title to the property claimed. For deciding whether the alleged acts of a person constituted adverse possession, the animus of the person doing those acts is the most crucial factor. Adverse possession is commenced in wrong and is aimed against right. A person is said to hold the property adversely to the real owner when that person in denial of the owner’s right excluded him from the enjoyment of his property.</li>
<li>…The High Court has erred in holding that even if the defendants claim adverse possession, they do not have to prove who is the true owner and even if they had believed that the Government was the true owner and not the plaintiffs, the same was inconsequential. Obviously, the requirements of proving adverse possession have not been established. If the defendants are not sure who is the true owner the question of their being in hostile possession and the question of denying title of the true owner do not raise…… Therefore, the defendants are in possession and enjoyment of the property knowing fully well that the property belonged to the plaintiff’s father and the plaintiff’s vendor also did not take any action to evict them and the plaintiff and his vendor were aware that the properties belonged to them and despite the same, the plaintiff’s vendor did not take any action to evict them. Hence, the appellants/defendants have also perfected title by adverse possession. Therefore, the 2nd substantial question of law of is answered in favour of the appellants/defendants.”</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration:underline">Possession is heritable and transferable</span></strong></p>
<p>Possession is a heritable and transferable right. [See: Nallammal Vs. Ayisha Beevi, 2017-5 Mad LJ 864; Phirayalal Kapur Vs. Jia Rani, AIR 1973 Delhi 186]. A settled possession can be protected by court-injunction.</p>
<p><strong><u>How to Plead</u></strong><span style="text-decoration:underline"> <strong>Adverse Possession </strong></span></p>
<p>It is really a troublesome matter for the advocates. Karnataka Board of Wakaf v. Govt of India – AIR 2004 SC 2096; T. Anjanappa v. Somalingappa – [(2006) 7 SCC 570]; and PT Munichikkanna Reddy v. Revamma – AIR 2007 SC 1753, guide us in this field. It may be necessary to plead the following modules.</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><em>The claimant has been in ‘<strong>hostile </strong>and <strong>open, continuous uninterrupted </strong></em><strong>as of right</strong><em>‘ possession of the land,</em></li>
<li><em>in <strong>denial of the title</strong></em> of the rightful owner,</li>
<li><strong><em>adversely</em></strong><em> to the interest</em> of the owner <em>of the land</em>,</li>
<li><strong><em>started </em></strong>with wrongful <strong><em>disposition</em></strong> of the rightful owner,</li>
<li><em>exercising <strong>absolute rights</strong> of ownership in respect of the land</em>,</li>
<li><em> on and from </em>.. . .. (Specify<em> <strong>date</strong></em>).</li>
</ul>
<p>And, it is appropriate to plead ‘hostile and open’ possession as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Claimant’s acts were<strong> hostile enough</strong> to make the true owner aware of the adverse possession;</li>
<li>or, he <strong><em>made the true owner knew</em> </strong>as to his hostile acts or adverse possession (from the inception).</li>
</ul>
<p>See Blog: <a href="https://indianlawlive.net/2021/03/11/adverse-possession-an-evolving-concept/"><strong>Adverse Possession: An Evolving Concept</strong></a></p>
<p><strong><u>Sec. 27,  Limitation Act</u></strong> <strong><span style="text-decoration:underline"> –  Extinguishment of right to property: </span></strong></p>
<p><em>Sec. 27 of the Limitation Act speaks that at the determination of the period “hereby limited to any person for instituting a suit for possession of any property”, his right to such property shall be extinguished.</em></p>
<p>Adverse possession confers title under Sec. 27 (by necessary implication, because extinguished title of real owner comes to vest in wrongdoer – because, rights thereon had already been lost to the true owner, and passed over to the ‘possessory/adverse’ owner).</p>
<p>Therefore it is clear that Sec. 27 is a provision in the Limitation Act that gives a substantial right to a party. In view of Sec. 27 one can seek declaration of title by adverse possession and consequential injunction or recovery. That is why it is held in <strong>Ravinder Kaur Grewal v. Manjit Kaur, </strong> AIR 2019 SC 3827: (2019) 8 SCC 729, that the person acquiring title by adverse possession can use it as a sword.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">Legal Position of Licencees</span></strong></p>
<p>In Samarpan Varishtha Jan Parisar v. Rajendra Prasad Agarwal, AIR 2022 SC 2209, our Apex Court held that the inmates in an old age home have <strong><u>no substantive</u></strong> <strong><u>right for seeking injunction</u></strong> as they are only <strong>licensees</strong>. The court relied on the following earlier decisions:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>In Associated Hotels of India v. R.N. Kapoor AIR 1959 SC 1262 it was held that in case of a licensee, the <u>legal possession continues with the owner</u> as in terms of Sec. 52 of the Indian Easements Act, 1882, grant of a mere right to do upon the property of another, something which would in the absence of such right be unlawful.</li>
<li>In Sohan Lal Naraindas v. Laxmidas Raghunath Gadit (1971) 1 SCC 276, it has been held that a lease creates an interest in the property whereas a <u>license creates no estate or interest</u> in the immovable property of the grantor.</li>
<li>In Behram Tejani and Ors. v. Azeem Jagani (2017) 2 SCC 759, it is held that a person holding the premises gratuitously or in the capacity as a <u>caretaker or a servant</u> would <u>not acquire any right or interest in the property</u> and even long possession in that capacity would be of no legal consequences.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Supreme Court quoted the following from the Three-Judge Bench decision in Maria Margarida Sequeira Fernandes v. Erasmo Jack De Sequeira, (2012) 5 SCC 370, which reads as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“1. No one acquires title to the property if he or she was allowed to stay in the premises <span style="text-decoration: underline">gratuitously</span>. Even by long possession of years or decades such person would not acquire any right or interest in the said property.</li>
<li>2. <span style="text-decoration: underline">Caretaker, watchman or servant</span> can never acquire interest in the property irrespective of his long possession. The caretaker or servant has to give possession forthwith on demand.</li>
<li>3. The Courts are not justified in protecting the possession of a caretaker, servant or any person who was allowed to live in the premises for some time either as a <span style="text-decoration: underline">friend, relative, caretaker or as a servant</span>.</li>
<li>4. The protection of the Court can only be granted or extended to the person who has <span style="text-decoration: underline">valid, subsisting rent agreement, lease agreement or license agreement</span> in his favour.</li>
<li>5. The <span style="text-decoration: underline">caretaker</span> or agent holds property of the principal only on behalf of the principal.

<p>While considering whether possessory title can be made the foundation for a suit in ejectment filed even after the expiry of six months, it is held in Kuttan Narayanan VS Thomman Mathai, AIR 1966 Ker 179, as under as regards ‘Possessory Title’.</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“6. Possession by itself is a substantive right recognised by law and has legal incidents attached to it apart from ownership. Even before the acquisition of statutory title by adverse possession for the requisite period under the Limitation Act, the possessory owner has well-defined rights in property. It is now settled beyond all dispute that this interest is heritable, devisable and transferable. This interest is referred to as possessory title as distinct from proprietory title. A person having such interest must be allowed to enforce those rights against all the world except those who have a better title or better right than himself. Salmond on Jurisprudence, Eleventh edition, observes at page 345:</li>
<li>“In English law possession is a good title of right against any one who cannot show a better. A wrongful possessor has the rights of an owner with respect to all persons except earlier possessors and except the true owner himself.”</li>
<li>and at pages 473 and 474 it is observed:</li>
<li>“On the other hand, the thing of which possession is taken may already be the property of some one else. In this case the title acquired by possession is good, indeed, against all third persons, but is of no validity at all against the true owner. Possession, even when consciously wrongful, is allowed as a title of right against all persons who cannot show a better, because of a prior title in themselves. Save with respect to the rights of the original proprietor, my rights to the watch in my pocket are much the same, whether I bought it honestly, or found it, or abstracted it from the pocket of some one else. If it is stolen from me, the law will help me to the recovery of it. I can effectually sell it, lend it give it away, or bequeath it, and it will go on my death intestate to my next of kin. Whoever acquires it from me, however, acquires in general nothing save my limited and imperfect title to it, and holds it, as I do, subject to the superior claims of the original owner.</li>
<li>If a possessory owner is wrongfully deprived of the thing by a person other than the true owner, he can recover it. For the defendant cannot set up as a defence his own possessory title, since it is later than, and consequently inferior to, the possessory title of the plaintiff. Nor can he set up as a defence the title of the true owner the jus tertii, as it is called; the plaintiff has a better, because an earlier, title than the defendant, and it is irrelevant that the title of some other person, not a party to the suit, is better still. The expediency of this doctrine of possessory ownership is clear. Were it not for such a rule, force and fraud would be left to determine all disputes as to possession, between persons of whom neither could show an unimpeachable title to the thing as the true owner of it.”</li>
<li>Pollock &amp; Wright in their book’Possession in the Common Law’ expressed themselves thus at “page 91:</li>
<li>“Existing possession, however acquired, is protected against any interference by a mere wrongdoer; and the wrongdoer cannot defend himself by showing a better title than the plaintiff’s in some third person through or under whom he does not himself claim or justify. ‘Any possession is a legal possession’ i. e. lawful and maintainable ‘against a wrongdoer.'”</li>
<li>and at page 95:</li>
<li>“It would be possible at first sight to suppose that, as between a succession of independent occupiers who were all wrongdoers as against the true owner, the law must be indifferent, with the result of conferring an absolute title upon the person who happens to be in possession when the time of limitation expires. Reflection, however, shows this to be contrary to the reason and principles of the law. Possession being once admitted to be a root of title, every possession must create a title which, as against all subsequent intruders, has all the incidents and advantages of a true title …In the language of the modern authorities, ‘possession is good title’ nothing less ‘against all but the true owner.”‘</li>
<li>7. The English doctrine of possessory title is expressed in the following terms by Cockburn, C. J., in Asher v. Whitlock 1886 Law Journal 35 Q. B. 17:</li>
<li>“I take it to be established by authority that possession is good against all the world except the person who can show a better title than the one in possession. Doe v. Dyeball ILR. 20 Cal. 834 shows that possession, even for a year, is sufficient against a mere subsequent possession. The whole law of disseisin was founded upon the principle that the disseisin gives title to the disseisor against all the world but the disseisee.”‘</li>
<li>8. Their Lordships of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in Perry v. Clissold &amp; c. 1907 A. C. 73, 79 decided :</li>
<li>“It cannot be disputed that a person in possession of land in the assumed character of owner and exercising peaceably the ordinary rights of ownership has a perfectly good title against all the world but the rightful owner. And if the rightful owner does not come forward and assert his title by process of law within the period prescribed by the provisions of the Statute of Limitations applicable to the case, his right is for ever extinguished, and the possessory owner acquires an absolute title.’</li>
<li>9. The above is certainly the doctrine of English Law. The rule of English Law that possession is good title against all but the true owner has been adopted by the decisions of the Indian High Courts and also by the decisions of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in the Indian cases. In Khajah Enaetoollah Chowdhry v. Kishen Soondur Surma &amp;c. VIII Weekly Reporter 386, 387 &amp; 388 Dwarkanath Mitter, J. posed the question thus:</li>
<li>“Can the Civil Courts give a decree for immovable property on the bare ground of illegal dispossession in a suit brought after six months from the date of such dispossession, it being borne in mind, however, that the defendant has failed to prove his own title to the same?”</li>
<li>and answered the same in the following terms:</li>
<li>“But we do not see any reason why a mere wrongful dispossessor should require proof from his adversary of anything beyond the illegal dispossession complained of. He himself has not got and never had any title to the land. The act of dispossession committed by him has been entirely without any sanction from law. Justice and equity require that he should be compelled to restore the party wronged by him to the same position which the latter enjoyed before the date of the illegal ejectment. To adopt the contrary view appears to us to be tantamount to holding out a premium in favour of wrong and violence.”</li>
<li>and in Hari Khandu v. Dhondi Natha VIII Bombay Law Reporter 96 Sir Lawrence Jenkins, C. J. said: “Possession is evidence of ownership, and is itself the foundation of a right to possession.” and Subramania Ayyar, J. in Mustapha Saheb &amp;c. v. Santha Pillai &amp;c. ILR. 23 Mad. 179,182 said:</li>
<li>“that the rule of law that a party ousted by a person who has no better right is. with reference to the person so ousting, entitled to recover by virtue of the possession he had held before the ouster even though that possession was without any title” is so firmly established as to render a lengthened discussion about it quite superfluous.”</li>
<li>10. In Sundar v. Parbati ILR. 12 All. 51 decided by their Lordships of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, the suit was for partition and recovery of possession filed by the junior widow of a deceased Hindu against the senior widow who denied the junior widow’s right to separate possession and contended that she was entitled to manage the whole estate. The Subordinate Judge decreed the plaintiff’s suit. A Bench of the Allahabad High Court reversed the decree of the Subordinate Judge and dismissed the suit. Lord Watson delivering the judgment of the Board, observed at page 57:</li>
<li>“If it were necessary to determine the point, their Lordships would probably have little difficulty in accepting the opinion of the High Court that a Hindu Brahman cannot lawfully adopt his own sister’s son. But apart from that question, and also from any question touching the legal effect of Baldeo Sahai’s will, the fact of joint possession by the two widows of the estates which belonged to the testator, ever since the death of Premsukh in 1879, appears to them to be sufficient for disposing of this suit in favour of the appellant. Their Lordships are at a loss to understand, at all events to appreciate, the grounds upon which the Chief Justice endeavours to differentiate between the authorities which he cites, the import of which he correctly states, and the position of the parties to this action. Their possession was lawfully attained, in this sense that it was not procured by force or fraud, but peaceably, no one interested opposing. In these circumstances, it does not admit of doubt that they are entitled to maintain their possession against all comers except the heirs of Premsukh or of Baldeo Sahai, one or other of whom (it is unnecessary to say which) is the only person who can plead a preferable title. But neither of these possible claimants is in the field, and the widows have therefore, each of them, an estate or interest in respect of her possession, which cannot be impaired by the circumstance that they may have ascribed their possession to one or more other titles which do not belong to them. It is impossible to hold that a joint estate is not also partible; and their Lordships will therefore humbly advise Her Majesty that the judgment of the High Court ought to be reversed, and that of the Subordinate Judge restored.”</li>
<li>The above principle was reiterated by their Lordships of the Judicial Committee in Ismail Ariff v. Mahomed Ghous ILR. 20 Cal. 834. At page 843 their Lordships observed:</li>
<li>“It appears to their Lordships that there is here a misapprehension of the nature of the plaintiff’s case upon the facts stated in the judgment. The possession of the plaintiff was sufficient evidence of title as owner against the defendant. By S.9 of the Specific Relief Act (Act 1 of 1877), if the plaintiff had been dispossessed otherwise than in due course of law, he could, by a suit instituted within six months from the date of the dispossession, have recovered possession, notwithstanding any other title that might be set up in such suit. If he could thus recover possession from a person who might be able to prove a title, it is certainly right and just that he should be able, against a person who has no title and is a mere wrong-doer, to obtain a declaration of title as owner, and an injunction to restrain the wrong-doer from interfering with his possession. The Appellate Court, in accordance with the judgment above quoted, has dismissed the suit. Consequently, the defendant may continue to wilfully, improperly and illegally interfere with the plaintiff’s possession, as the learned judge say he has done, and the plaintiff has no remedy. Their Lordships are of opinion that the suit should not have been dismissed; and that the plaintiff was entitled in it to a declaration of his title to the land.”</li>
<li>The principle underlying the rule that possession is a good title against all the world except the person who can show a better title is stated thus in Narayana Row v. Dharmachar ILR. 26 Mad: 514, 518:</li>
<li>“The principle underlying the rule of law in question seems to be that acquisition of title by operation of the law of limitation being a lawful mode of acquiring title, the person in peaceable possession is entitled to maintain such possession against all but the true owner and that therefore a third party who has no better title than the person in possession has no right to invade upon the possession of the latter and interrupt or arrest his lawful acquisition of title by his continuing to remain in possession for the statutory period. ‘ It is the true owner alone that is entitled to assert his title as against the person wrongfully in possession, and prevent such wrongful possession ripening into prescriptive title. But a third party who without deriving title under the true owner and without his authority, interrupts such possession before it has ripened into prescriptive title, is a trespasser, not only against the true owner, but also against the party actually in possession; and. subject to the law of limitation, either of them is entitled to maintain a suit in ejectment against such intruder as a trespasser.”</li>
<li>11. We are therefore of the view that a person in juridical possession, if dispossessed by a trespasser without title, can recover possession on the sole ground of his prior possession even beyond six months from the date of dispossession and this is enough to dispose of the second appeal.</li>
<li>12. But the learned advocate for the appellant relying on the decision in Nisa Chand Gaita &amp; C.V.. Kanchiram Bagani ILR. 26 Cal. 579 submitted that mere previous possession for any period short of the statutory period of twelve years will not entitle a plaintiff to a decree for recovery of possession in a suit brought more than six months after dispossession, even if the defendant could not establish any title to the disputed land. The. point which, arose for decision in ILR. 26 Cal. 579 was whether the plaintiff is entitled to a decree merely upon proof of previous possession for a period less than twelve years, on the ground that the defendant has established no title, the suit having been brought more than six months after the date of dispossession. ILR. 20 Cal. 834 was distinguished thus:</li>
<li>“There (in ILR. 20 Cal. 834) the plaintiff was in possession when he brought his suit, whereas in the present case the plaintiff is out of possession. What the plaintiff asked for in the case of Ismail Ariff v. Mahomed Ghous was a decree declaring his right, and an injunction restraining the defendant from disturbing his possession; what the plaintiff asks for in this case is only recovery of possession; and what was said by their Lordships of the Judicial Committee with reference to the plaintiff’s right to obtain this relief is to be found in the following passage of their judgment: “It appears to their Lordships that there is here a misapprehension of the nature of the plaintiff’s case upon the facts stated in the judgment. The possession of the plaintiff was sufficient evidence of title as owner against the defendant. By S.9 of the Specific Relief Act (1 of 1877), if the plaintiff had been dispossessed otherwise than in due course of law, he could by a suit instituted within six months from the date of the dispossession, have recovered possession, notwithstanding any other title that might be setup in such suit. If he could thus recover possession from a person who might be able to prove a title, it is certainly right and just that he should be able, against a person who has no title and is a mere wrong doer, to obtain a declaration of title as owner, and an injunction to restrain the wrong-doer from interfering with his possession.” This shows, as we understand the judgment, that the reason for their Lordships’ decision was this: that as the plaintiff, had his position been rendered somewhat worse by his being dispossessed, could, by instituting a suit within six months for recovery of possession under S.9 of the Specific Relief Act, have recovered possession even as against a person who might establish a better title, it was only right and just that if he brought his suit before he was dispossessed he could be declared entitled to retain possession as against a mere wrong-doer, and should obtain an injunction restraining the wrong-doer from interfering with his possession. But, though that was so in the case of a plaintiff who was in possession, and had, therefore, a possibility open to him of being restored to possession upon mere proof of possession, by instituting a suit under S.9 of the Specific Relief Act upon being dispossessed, it does not follow that it should be so in the case of a plaintiff who had been in possession, and allowed more than six months to elapse after his dispossession, and therefore lost the possibility of recovering possession, by a suit under S.9 of the Specific Relief Act, upon mere proof of previous possession.”</li>
<li>13. Distinguishing I. L. R.20 Cal. 834 in the above manner, the Calcutta High Court in ILR. 26 Cal, 579 sought support for the dictum in the following observations of the Privy Council in J. P. Wise &amp;c. v. Ameerunnissa Khatoon &amp; c. VII L. R. Indian Appeals 73, 80.</li>
<li>“It is quite clear that the plaintiff’s have failed to make out a title. The Defendants were put into possession by the Government, who were entitled to the lands, and they were ordered by the Magistrate under the Code of Criminal Procedure to be retained in possession. If the Plaintiffs had wished to contend that the Defendants had been wrongfully put into possession and that the Plaintiffs were entitled to recover on the strength of their previous possession without entering into a question of title at all, they ought to have brought their action within six months under S.15 of Act XIV of 1859; but they did not do so. The High Court, with reference to this point say (and, in their Lordships’ opinion, correctly say): “Further, de facto possession having been given to the Defendants under S.318 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, in accordance with the Deputy Collector’s award, the plaintiff will not be entitled to a decree until and unless he can show a better title to these lands than the Defendants. The fact that the Plaintiffs’ possession as regards B, C, and D was confirmed under Act IV of 1840, and that the defendants Nos. 2 and 3 unsuccessfully endeavoured to disturb them by regular suit, does not bar the right of Government. S.2 of Act IV of 1840 only affects persons concerned in the dispute. If Kalkini had belonged to a private individual he might have reduced into his own possession lands which had accreted to the estate and which undoubtedly were his. But lands to which he is unable to make out a title cannot be recovered on the ground of previous possession merely, except in a suit under S.15 of Act XIV of 1859, which must be brought within six months from the time of that dispossession.”</li>
<li>The Calcutta High Court on an interpretation of ILR. 20 Cal. 834 and L. R. VII I. A. 73 has therefore taken the view that S.9 of the Act operates as a bar to the institution of suits in which the claim for possession of any immovable property is based on anything but proprietory title.</li>
<li>14. On the other hand, the decision in ILR. 20 Cal. 834 was relied on by the other High Courts for the position that possessory title can be made the foundation for suits in ejectment filed after six months from the date of dispossession against trespassers who have noctitle.</li>
<li>15. The effective answer to the basis of the decision of the Calcutta High Court in ILR. 26 Cal. 579 has been furnished by Subramania Ayyar &amp; O’ Farrelll JJ. in Mustapha Saheb &amp; c. v. Santha Pillai &amp; c. ILR. 23 Mad. 179,183. Subramania Ayyar J. at page 183 observed:</li>
<li>“And with reference to the grounds on which decision in Nisa Chand Gaita v. Kanchiram Bayani (ILR. 26 Cal. 579) seems to rest, it is necessary to make but two observations. The first is that S.9 of the Specific Relief Act cannot possibly be held to take away any remedy available with reference to the well-recognised doctrine expressed in Pollock and Wright on Possession thus: Possession in law is a substantive right or interest which exists and has legal incidents and advantages apart from the true owner’s title, (at page 19). The second observation is that in Wise v. Ameerunnissa Khatoon (L. R.7 I. A. 73) relied on in Nisa Chand Gaita v. Kanchiram Bagani (ILR. 26 Cal. 579) the defendant had a better right than the plaintiff, since the possession of the former was authorised by the Government whose property the land in dispute was and consequently nothing said by their Lordships in a case wherein such were the facts can rightly be construed as intended to lay down the law differently from what it had been all along understood to be.”</li>
<li>and O’Farrell, J. observed:</li>
<li>“All the dictum of the Privy Council in Wise v. Ameerunnissa Khatoon (L. R.7 I. A. 73) appears to amount to is this, that where a plaintiff in possession without any title seeks to recover possession of which he has been forcibly deprived by a defendant having a good title, he can only do so under the provisions of S.9 of the Specific Relief Act and not otherwise.”</li>
<li>16. The Madras High Court again in ILR. 26 Mad. 514 relying on ILR. 20 Cal. 834 took the view that S.9 of the Act is in no way inconsistent with the position that as against a wrong-doer, prior possession of the plaintiff in an action of ejectment is sufficient title, even if a suit is brought more than six months after the date of dispossession and the wrong-doer cannot successfully resist the suit by showing that the title and right to possession are in a third person, and a plea of jus tertii is no defence unless the defendant can show that the act complained of was done by authority of the true owner and it is immaterial however short or recent the plaintiff’s possession was. The only effect of S.9 of the Act is that if a summary suit be brought within the time prescribed by that section, the plaintiff therein who was dispossessed otherwise than in due course of law will be entitled to be reinstated even if the defendant who thus dispossessed him be the true owner or a person authorised by or claiming under him, but a decree in such a suit will not have the force of res judicata on the question of title.</li>
<li>17. We are in respectful agreement with the observations in ILR. 23 Mad. 179 and hold that the decision in ILR. 26 Cal. 579 has proceeded on an incorrect interpretation of the decisions in ILR. 20 Cal 834 and L. R.7 I. A. 73.</li>
<li>18. There remains only to consider the decision of Mr. Justice Raman. Nayar in Vasudeva Kurup v. Ammini Amma 1964 KLT. 468 where it was held that a person in possession without title is entitled to remain in possession even as against the lawful owner until evicted in due course of law and is therefore entitled to get an order of injunction restraining the true owner from disturbing his possession. The right of a person in possession without title to get an injunction on the basis of possessory title against the true owner is not a point arising in the second appeal and we are not expressing any opinion on that aspect. The point decided in 1964 KLT. 468 has no direct bearing on the question to be decided in the second appeal except that possessory title is recognised as the foundation of a claim for maintaining one’s possession. This only supports the view we are taking in this appeal.</li>
<li>19. We therefore fall in line with the decisions of the Allahabad, Madras, Bombay and Patna High Courts and hold that possessory title can be made the foundation for a suit in ejectment filed even after the expiry of six months from the date of possession against a trespasser who has no title.”</li>
