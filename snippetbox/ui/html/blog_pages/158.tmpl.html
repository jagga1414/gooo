<p>The position of law is laid down in <strong>K.G. Premshanker v. Inspector of Police</strong>, (2002) 8 SCC 87: AIR 2002 SC 3372, as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“30. <u>What emerges from the aforesaid discussion is</u> –</li>
<li>(1) the previous judgment which is final <strong><u>can be relied upon</u></strong> as provided under <strong><u>Sections 40 to 43</u></strong> of the Evidence Act;</li>
<li>(2) in civil suits between the same parties, principle of <strong><u>res-judicata may apply</u></strong>;</li>
<li>(3) in a criminal case, <strong><u>Section 300 Cr.P.C</u></strong>. makes provision that once a person is convicted or acquitted, he <strong><u>may not be tried again</u></strong> for the same offence if the conditions mentioned therein are satisfied;</li>

Section 41 provides which judgment would be conclusive proof of what is stated therein.”</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Case to be determined on Evidence, not on Previous Judgment </strong></span></p>
<p>Referring the above portion, in <strong>Seth Ramdayal Jat v. Laxmi Prasad, (2009) 11 SCC 545</strong>, it is observed as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“16.<span style="text-decoration: underline"> If a primacy is given to a criminal proceeding</span>, indisputably, the civil suit must be <span style="text-decoration: underline">determined</span> on its own keeping in view the evidence which has been brought on record before it and <span style="text-decoration: underline">not in terms of the evidence</span> brought in the criminal proceeding.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><u>Court has to Decide – To what extent previous Judgment is Binding</u></strong></p>
<p>K.G. Premshanker v. Inspector of Police continued as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“Further, the judgment, order or decree passed in a previous civil proceeding, if relevant, as provided under Sections 40 and 42 or other provisions of the Evidence Act then in each case, Court has to decide to what extent it is binding or conclusive with regard to the matter(s) decided therein.</li>
<li>Take for illustration, in a case of alleged trespass by ‘A’ on ‘B’s property, ‘B’ filed a <span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>suit for declaration</strong> of its title and to recover possession</span> from ‘A’ and suit is decreed. Thereafter, <span style="text-decoration: underline">in a <strong>criminal prosecution</strong></span> by ‘B’ against ‘A’ for trespass, <span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>judgment</strong> passed between the parties in civil proceedings would be <strong>relevant</strong></span> and Court may hold that it conclusively establishes the title as well as possession of ‘B’ over the property. In such case, <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">‘A’ may be convicted for trespass</span></strong>. The illustration to Section 42 which is quoted above makes the position clear.</li>
<li>Hence, in each and every case, first question which would require consideration is whether judgment, order or decree is relevant?, if relevant its effect. It may be <span style="text-decoration: underline">relevant for a limited purpose</span>, such as, motive or as a fact in issue. This would depend upon facts of each case.”</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><u>Sans Sec. 41 – 43, No Legal Principle – Findings of Civil Court Bind  Cril. Court</u></strong></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline">Standard of proof is different in civil and criminal cases</span>.</p>
<p>In <strong>Avitel Post Studioz Limited v. HSBC PI Holdings (Mauritius) Limited, 2021-4 SCC 713</strong>, the principles in K.G. Premshanker v. Inspector of Police, (2002) 8 SCC 87: AIR 2002 SC 3372, is followed and held –</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“18. Thus, in view of the above, the law on the issue <strong><u>stands crystallised</u></strong> to the effect that the <span style="text-decoration: underline">findings</span> of fact recorded <span style="text-decoration: underline">by the civil court do not have any bearing</span> so far as the criminal case is concerned and vice versa. <span style="text-decoration: underline">Standard of proof is different in civil and criminal cases</span>. In civil cases it is <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">preponderance of probabilities</span></strong> while in criminal cases it is proof <span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>beyond reasonable doubt</strong></span>. There is neither any statutory nor any legal principle that findings recorded by the court either in civil or criminal proceedings shall be binding between the same parties while dealing with the same subject-matter and both the cases have to be decided on the basis of the evidence adduced therein. <span style="text-decoration: underline">However, there may be cases</span> where the provisions of <span style="text-decoration: underline">Sections 41 to 43</span> of the Evidence Act, 1872, dealing with the relevance of previous judgments in subsequent cases <span style="text-decoration: underline">may be taken into consideration</span>.</li>
</ul>
<p>It is further pointed out in Avitel Post Studioz Limited v. HSBC PI Holdings (Mauritius) Limited, 2021-4 SCC 713 –</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“Moreover, the judgment, order or decree passed in previous civil proceedings, if relevant, as provided under Sections 40 and 42 or other provisions of the Evidence Act then in each case <strong><u><mark class="has-inline-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#1407f1">the court has to decide to what extent it is binding or conclusive with regard to the matters decided therein</mark>.</u></strong> In each and every case the first question which would require consideration is, whether the judgment, order or decree is relevant; if relevant, its effect. <strong><u>This would depend upon the facts of each case</u></strong>.”</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><u>Not Correct – Civil Decisions Bind Criminal Courts, and Converse – Not True</u></strong></p>
<p>Our Apex Court observed in Karam Chand Ganga Prasad v. Union of India, 1970-3 SCC 694, that the decisions of the <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">civil courts will be binding on the criminal courts</span></strong> but the converse is not true. It is overruled in KG Premshanker v. Inspector of Police (2002) 8 SCC 87.</p>
<p>Overruling Karam Chand Ganga Prasad. v. Union of India, 1970-3 SCC 69<strong>4</strong>, it is held in KG Premshanker v. Inspector of Police (2002) 8 SCC 87as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“33. Hence, the observation made by this Court in V.M. Shah case that the finding recorded by the criminal court stands superseded by the finding recorded by the civil court is not correct enunciation of law. Further, the general observations made in Karam Chand case (Karam Chand Ganga Prasad v. Union of India, (1970-3 SCC 694) are in context of the facts of the case stated above. The Court was not required to consider the earlier decision of the Constitution Bench in M.S. Sheriff case (M.S. Sheriff v. State of Madras, AIR 1954 SC 397) as well as Sections 40 to 43 of the Evidence Act.”</li>
</ul>
<p>While referring KG Premshanker v. Inspector of Police (2002) 8 SCC 87, it is held in <strong>Syed Askari Hadi Ali Augustine Imam v. State (Delhi Admn.), 2009- 5 SCC 528</strong> as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“It is, however, significant to notice that the decision of this Court in M/s Karam Chand Ganga Prasad v. Union of India (1970) 3 SCC 694, wherein it was categorically held that the decisions of the civil courts will be binding on the criminal courts but the converse is not true, was<span style="text-decoration: underline"> overruled</span>, stating:
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“33. Hence, the observation made by this Court in <strong>V.M. Shah case</strong> that the finding recorded by the criminal court stands <span style="text-decoration: underline">superseded by the finding recorded by the civil court is not correct enunciation of law</span>. Further, the general observations made in Karam Chand case are in context of the facts of the case stated above. The Court was not required to consider the earlier decision of the Constitution Bench in M.S. Sheriff case (M.S. Sheriff v. State of Madras, AIR 1954 SC 397) as well as Sections 40 to 43 of the Evidence Act.”</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>11. Axiomatically, <span style="text-decoration: underline">if judgment of a civil court is not binding on a criminal court, a judgment of a criminal court will certainly not be binding on a civil court</span>. We have noticed hereinbefore that Section 43 of the Evidence Act categorically states that judgments, orders or decrees, other than those mentioned in sections 40, 41 and 42 are irrelevant, unless the existence of such judgment, order or decree, is a fact in issue, or is relevant under some other provisions of the Act. No other provision of the Evidence Act or for that matter any other statute has been brought to our notice.”</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">A judgment in rem (Section 43</span></strong>) <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">is conclusive in criminal and civil proceedings</span></strong></p>
<p>In Syed Askari Hadi Ali Augustine Imam v. State (Delhi Admn.), 2009- 5 SCC 528, it is held as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“Rendition of a final judgment which would be binding on the whole world being conclusive in nature shall take a long time. As and when a judgment is rendered in one proceeding subject to the admissibility thereof keeping in view Section 43 of the Evidence Act may be produced in another proceeding. It is, however, beyond any cavil that a judgment rendered by a <span style="text-decoration: underline">probate court </span>is a judgment in rem. It is binding on all courts and authorities. Being a <span style="text-decoration: underline">judgment in rem</span> it will have effect over other judgments. A judgment in rem indisputably is conclusive in a criminal as well as in a civil proceeding.” (Surinder Kumar v. Gian Chand, AIR 1957 SC 875, is relied on)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">Civil or Criminal proceedings be stayed – Depends upon each case</span></strong></p>
<p>In <strong>M.S. Sheriff v. State of Madras, AIR 1954 SC 397</strong>, the Constitution Bench considered whether a civil suit or a criminal case should be stayed in the event both are pending; and it was opined that the criminal matter should be given precedence.</p>
<p> In P. Swaroopa Rani v. M. Hari Narayana @ Hari Babu, AIR 2008 SC 1884, it was held as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“13. It is, however, well-settled that in a given case, civil proceedings and criminal proceedings can proceed simultaneously. Whether civil proceedings or criminal proceedings shall be stayed depends upon the fact and circumstances of each case.” (Quoted in: Syed Askari Hadi Ali Augustine Imam v. State (Delhi Admn.), 2009- 5 SCC 528)</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>No Statutory Provision nor any Legal Principle – Findings in one treated as Final</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline">Standards of proof required in the two proceedings are entirely different</span></p>
<p>In <strong>Iqbal Singh Marwah v. Meenakshi Marwah, 2005-4 SCC 370</strong>, (relying inter alia on M.S. Sheriff v. State of Madras, AIR 1954 SC 397) it was held as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“32. Coming to the last contention that an effort should be made to avoid conflict of findings between the civil and criminal courts, it is necessary to point out that the <span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>standards of proof</strong></span> required in the two proceedings are entirely different. Civil cases are decided on the basis of <span style="text-decoration: underline">preponderance </span>of evidence while in a criminal case the entire burden lies on the prosecution and proof<span style="text-decoration: underline"> beyond reasonable doubt</span> has to be given. There is <span style="text-decoration: underline">neither any statutory provision nor any legal principle that the findings recorded in one proceeding may be treated as final or binding</span> in the other, as both the cases have to be decided on the basis of the evidence adduced therein.”</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><u>Sections 41 – 43,  Evidence Act</u></strong></p>
<p>Section 40, Evidence Act reads as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“40. Previous judgments relevant to bar a second suit or trial. The existence of any judgment, order or decree which by law prevents any Courts from taking cognizance of a suit or holding a trial is a relevant fact when the question is whether such Court ought to take cognizance of such suit or to hold such trial.”</li>
</ul>
<p>Section 41 reads thus:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“41. Relevancy of certain judgments in probate, etc., jurisdiction. A final judgment, order or decree of a competent Court, in the exercise of probate, matrimonial, admiralty or insolvency jurisdiction which confers upon or takes away from any person any legal character, or which declares any person to be entitled to any such character, or to be entitled to any specific thing, not as against any specified person but absolutely, is relevant when the existence of any such legal character, or the title of any such person to any such thing, is relevant.</li>
</ul>
<p>Section 42 reads:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“42. Relevancy and effect of judgments, orders or decrees, other than those mentioned in section 41. Judgments, orders or decrees other than those mentioned in section 41, are relevant if they relate to matters of a public nature relevant to the enquiry, but such judgments, orders or decrees are not conclusive proof of that which they state.”</li>
<li>Illustration:</li>
<li>A sues B for trespass on his land. B alleges the existence of a public right of way over the land, which A denies.</li>
<li>The existence of a decree in favour of the defendant, in a suit by A against C for a trespass on the same land in which C alleged the existence of the same right of way, is relevant, but it is not conclusive proof that the right of way exists.</li>
</ul>
<p>Section 43, Evidence Act reads as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>43.<span style="text-decoration: underline"> Judgments, etc., other than those mentioned in sections 40 to 42, when relevant</span>. Judgments, orders or decrees, other than those mentioned in sections 40, 41 and 42, are irrelevant, unless the existence of such judgment, order or decree, is a fact in issue, or is relevant under some other provisions of this Act.</li>
<li>Illustrations</li>
<li>.(a) A and B separately sue C for a libel which reflects upon each of them. C in each case says, that the matter alleged to be libellous is true, and the circumstances are such that it is probably true in each case, or in neither. A obtains a decree against C for damages on the ground that C failed to make out his justification. The fact is irrelevant as between B and C.</li>
<li>(b) A prosecutes B for adultery with C, A’s wife. B denies that C is A’s wife, but the court convicts B of adultery. Afterwards, C is prosecuted for bigamy in marrying B during A’s lifetime. C says that she never was A’s wife. The judgment against B is irrelevant as against C.</li>
<li>(c) A prosecutes B for stealing a cow from him, B, is convicted. A afterwards sues C for the cow, which B had sold to him before his conviction. As between A and C, the judgment against B is irrelevant.</li>
<li>(d) A has obtained a decree for the possession of land against B, C, B’s son, murders A in consequence. The existence of the judgment is relevant, as showing motive for a crime. 1[(e) A is charged with theft and with having been previously convicted of theft. The previous conviction is relevant as a fact in issue.</li>
<li>(f) A is tried for the murder of B. The fact that B prosecuted A for libel and that A was convicted and sentenced is relevant under section 8 as showing the motive for the fact in issue because the existence of the earlier Judgment in the civil case showed that ‘motive’ under Section 8 from the latter crime; in (e), relevancy is accepted because it is a ‘fact in issue’ in the latter case; in (f) relevancy is accepted because the earlier judgment is evidence of motive under Section 8 in the latter case.</li>
