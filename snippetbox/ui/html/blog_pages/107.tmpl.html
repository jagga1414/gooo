<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“(19) That the word “vest” is a word of variable import is shown by provisions of Indian statutes also. For example, S. 56 of the Provincial Insolvency Act (5 of 1920) empowers the Court at the time of the making of the order of adjudication or thereafter to appoint a receiver for the property of the insolvent and further provides that “such property shall thereupon vest in such receiver”. The property vests in the receiver for the purpose of administering the estate of the insolvent for the payment of his debts after realising his assets. The property of the insolvent vests in the receiver not for all purposes but only for the purpose of the Insolvency Act and the receiver has no interest of his own in the property. On the other hand, Ss. 16 and 17 of the Land Acquisition Act (Act 1 of LA), provide that the property so acquired, upon the happening of certain events, shall “vest absolutely in the Government free from all encumbrances”. In the cases contemplated by Ss. 16 and 17 the property acquired becomes the property of Government without any conditions or limitations either as to title or possession. The legislature has made it clear that the vesting of the property is not for any limited purpose or limited duration. It would thus appear that the word “vest” has not got a fixed connotation meaning in all cases that the property is owned by the person or the authority in whom it vests. It may <span style="text-decoration:underline">vest in title, or it may vest in possession, or it may vest in a limited sense</span>, as indicated in the context in which it may have been used in a particular piece of legislation. The provisions of the Improvement Act, particularly Ss. 45 to 49 and 54 and 54-A when they speak of a certain building or street or square or other land vesting in a municipality or other local body or in a trust, do not necessarily mean that ownership has passed to any of them.” [Quoted in Indore Development Authority vs Manoharlal (Arun Mishra, J.), (2020) 8 SCC 129.]</li>

<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“S.87. <span style="text-decoration:underline">Excess land obtained by gift, etc. to be surrendered</span> – (1) Where any person acquires any land dafter the date notified under Section 83 by gift, purchase, mortgage with possession, lease, surrender or any other kind of transfer inter vivos or by bequest or inheritance or otherwise and in consequence thereof the total extent of land owned or held by such person exceeds the ceiling area, such excess shall be surrendered to such authority as may be prescribed.</li>
<li>       Explanation 1 – Where any land is exempted by or under Section 81 and such exemption is in force on the date notified under Section 83, such land shall, with effect from the date on which it ceases to be exempted, be deemed to be land acquired after the date notified under Section 83.</li>

</ul>
<p>Explanation II is explained by the Full Bench of the Kerala High Court in Mathew K. Jacob v. District Environmental Impact Assessment Authority,2018-4 KLT 913, as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“The <span style="text-decoration:underline">consequence is that</span> the benefit of the exemption would be lost and <span style="text-decoration:underline">the extent added to the account of the assessee</span> or the declarant <span style="text-decoration:underline">in determination of his ceiling area</span>.”</li>
</ul>
<p>That is, if a person converts any portion of his exempted land to any other class, that converted extent will be added to his account in determining his ceiling limit; and the Taluk Land Board can proceed upon that (excess) land. In short, the exemption will be lost for that portion. </p>

<p>The decision in One Earth One Life v. State of Kerala, 2019-2 KHC(SN) 10; 2019-1 KLT 985, arose from the Writ Petition filed for a declaration that the fragmentation and sale of a Rubber Plantation for non-plantation purposes was illegal as it defeated the purpose of the Kerala Land Reforms Act. When the matter was placed before the Taluk Land Board under Sec 87, KLR Act, it found that there was no change in classification of the land and therefore dropped the proceedings. The High Court held as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“34. Section 81 of the KLR Act is in pith and substance a special provision, with its <span style="text-decoration:underline">main objective of giving exemption</span> to certain lands including the lands maintained as plantations is to <span style="text-decoration:underline">prevent fragmentation</span> of the land and to keep it as plantation itself <span style="text-decoration:underline">to improve the economy of the state</span> for welfare of people as a whole while the Act creates a regime, the State is under an obligation to safeguard, the intended purpose of the provisions of the Act in its spirit. ….. …… I<span style="text-decoration:underline">t could be gathered from the records that</span> t<span style="text-decoration:underline">he proposal to transfer</span> 1.03 acres of land to each workers in discharge of their service or retrenchment benefits <span style="text-decoration:underline">will definitely divide the plantation into separate slots</span> and that would <span style="text-decoration:underline">definitely change the character/nature of the plantation, which could be termed as ‘conversion’</span> and that will be against the provisions of the Act.”</li>
<li>“37. …. <span style="text-decoration:underline">Fragmentation of the estate and transfer</span> of it <span style="text-decoration:underline">has to be treated</span> as <span style="text-decoration:underline">a case of conversion </span>of plantation <span style="text-decoration:underline">into some other category</span> of land. Such being the scenario, fragmentation amounts to serious violation of the provisions of KLR Act. Hence, we are not impressed by the argument of the learned counsel for the respondent No.18 that the fragmented plots will be maintained as plantation by the transferees, so as to extend/avail the benefit of HMT’s case (supra). Taking into account of all the relevant aspects, we have no hesitation in holding that <span style="text-decoration:underline">dropping of the suo motu proceedings initiated under Section 87 of KLR Act by the TLB</span> in a cursory manner, <span style="text-decoration:underline">is not at all reasonable or justifiable </span>when tested on the touchstone of the object and intention, which the legislation seeks to achieve and beyond what is required, in the interest of the public.”</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>7</strong>. <strong><span style="text-decoration:underline">Can a Tenant of Plantation Transfer his Rights, Fragmenting the Plantation</span></strong></p>
<p>Possession by itself is a substantive right recognised by law. It is heritable and transferable. (Kuttan Narayanan v. Thomman Mathayi, AIR 1966 Ker 179; Phirayalal Kapur Vs. Jia Rani, AIR 1973 Delhi 186; Nallammal Vs. Ayisha Beevi, 2017-5 Mad LJ 864). </p>

<p>Therefore, a tenant of plantation having rights of fixity (Sec. 13) may have the right to transfer it to another. In any case, the change of character or nature of the plantation by <span style="text-decoration:underline">fragmentation being amount to ‘conversion’</span> that will be against the provisions of the Act, as pointed out in One Earth One Life v. State of Kerala, 2019-2 KHC(SN) 10; 2019-1 KLT 985.</p>

In calculating the extent of land owned or held by a family or an adult unmarried person, Sub-section (3) of Section 82 provides for taking into account the share held by a member or members of the family or adult unmarried person jointly with other persons.

<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>But, <strong><em>Sec. 112</em></strong> of the KLR Act says as to ‘Apportionment of land value in cases of acquisition’.</li>
<li>Because of the “<strong>Legal Right conferred by Statute</strong>“ upon the former tenants of the plantation, they are entitled for certain compensation, when that land is required for the Govt..</li>
<li>In cases falling under Chapter II (pertaining to, tenants entitled for fixity, issuance of purchase certificate etc.) Section 72 deals with the right, title and interest of the land owners and intermediaries in respect of the holdings held by the cultivating tenants; and says -the land will be free from encumbrances created by the land-owners and intermediaries.</li>
<li>However, insofar as the cultivating tenant is concerned, an absolute right is vested with him to seek assignment (within ceiling limit) subject to the payment of purchase price – as stated in Section 72D. (See: Glen Leven Estate (P) Ltd. v. State of Kerala, 2022-6 Ker LT 439.)</li>
<li>No ‘authority’ is also named in any law to fix the compensation to be given to the former tenants, when the Govt. requires it.</li>

<p><strong><u>Apportionment depends upon rights on the date of acquisition</u></strong></p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Valia Raja v. Veeraraghava Iyer, 1961 Ker LT 103, it was held that the question of apportionment of compensation has to depend upon the rights of the parties on the date of the acquisition. Referrd to in: Varkey Thomas Vs. Annamma Abraham,  1969 Ker LT 903.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><u>Glen Leven Estate (P) Ltd. v. State of Kerala, 2022-6 Ker LT 439</u></strong></p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>In Glen Leven Estate (P) Ltd. v. State of Kerala, 2022-6 Ker LT 439, the question as to ‘rival claims raised by the cultivating tenant and landlord for compensation on acquisition’ arose. The land was leased out by landlords. The lease-rights came in the cultivating tenants by transfer. The Government contended that the tenant was a cultivating tenant and the land vested upon the Govt. under Sec. 72 KLR Act. Hence tenant alone would be entitled to get compensation for the improvements to be determined under the Kerala Compensation for Tenants Improvements Act, 1958, in view of Section 20(1) of the KLR Act.</li>
<li>The landlords argued that the land was a plantation (over 30 acres) when it was (originally) leased, and therefore, they are entitled to claim exemption and benefits in the light of the exemption under clause (viii)  of Section 3 (1) of the KLR Act. Since there would be no fixity of tenure, it being a plantation, there would not be vesting of rights of the land owner in the Government. Hence, there should be the apportionment of the compensation between the lessor and the lessee and it should be decided in the acquisition proceedings.</li>
<li>The single Judge dismissed the writ petition, ‘leaving open the liberty of the lessee as well as the landlords, to approach the civil court seeking relief against the Government, and also to resolve the inter se dispute by and between the tenant and the landlords’.</li>
<li>The Division Bench, in appeal held that ‘land acquisition’ proceedings are to be initiated. It is pointed out that (even if it is a land vested in Govt.) there is no provision in Sec. 72 for ‘resuming’ if and when Govt. need it. The court also observed as under –
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“31. On an analysis of the provisions of Section 72(1) of the Act, 1963, it is clear that when the Government notified the said provision with effect from 01.01.1970, all right, title and interest of the landowners and intermediaries in respect of holdings held by cultivating tenants (including holders of kudiyirippus and holders karaimas) entitled to fixity of tenure under Section 13, and in respect of which certificates of purchase under sub-Section (2) of Section 59 have not been issued, vested in the Government.</li>
<li>32. Therefore, it is clear from Section 72 that what is vested with the Government is the right, title and interest of the land owners and intermediaries in respect of the holdings held by the cultivating tenants. It is nothing but a legal fiction by which the interest held by a cultivating tenant in a property of a landlord or intermediary is protected from 01.01.1970 .</li>
<li>34. On a conjoint reading of Sections 72 and 72A, it can be seen that vesting of rights in the Government contained under Section 72 is the rights held by the landlord and the intermediary in respect of holdings held by the cultivating tenants. However, the same will not, in any manner, interfere with the rights enjoyed by a cultivating tenant in contemplation of the provisions of the Act, 1963.”</li>
<li>42. Therefore, we have no doubt in our mind to hold that Section 72 of Act, 1963 would only deal with the right, title and interest of the land owners and intermediaries in respect of the holdings held by the cultivating tenants free from encumbrances created by the land owners and intermediaries. However, the legal provisions discussed above would make it clear that insofar as the cultivating tenant is concerned, an absolute right is vested with him to seek assignment subject to the payment of purchase price in contemplation of Section 72D of the Act, 1963.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>While considering the right of landlord, it is pointed out (basing on the principle, or scheme of the KLR Act<strong><mark class="has-inline-color has-primary-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">*<sup>*</sup></mark></strong>) that the landlord may have right for compensation under Section 72BB. The Division Bench said-<ul><li>“36. So also, sub-Section (1) of Section 72BB dealing with ‘the right of landlord to apply for assignment and compensation’ specifies that any landowner or intermediary, whose right, title and interest in respect of any holding have vested in the Government, may apply to the Land Tribunal for the assignment of such right, title and interest to the cultivating tenant and for the payment of the compensation due to him under Section 72A.”</li></ul></li>

<p>How to deal with Govt. property upon which title is claimed by plaintiffs dealt with in <strong>Union of India v. Ibrahim Uddin, : (2012) 8 SCC 148</strong>.</p>
<p>Facts, in a nutshell, were this –</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Plaintiff Ibrahim Uddin filed the Suit for declaration that he was the owner of the suit property originally had been with the Maratha Government.</li>
<li>The ancestors of the plaintiff having close association with the Maratha Government, were made a grant in respect of the suit land in the year 1800.</li>
<li>The land was partitioned between the ancestors in 1819.</li>
<li>The Union of India claimed title over the suit land, thus the suit.</li>
<li>UoI averred that the land belonged to it, a part of which has been leased out to several persons for agriculture work and their lease has been renewed from time to time.</li>
<li>As they became unauthorised occupants, proceedings had been initiated in accordance with law and eviction order had been passed against the occupants/tenants.</li>
<li>The trial Court came to the conclusion that the plaintiff could not prove any kind of grant by the Maratha Government to his ancestors in 1800.</li>
<li>Plaintiff failed to prove the partition between his ancestors in 1819.</li>
<li>The lease deed alleged to have been executed in favour of the Military Estate Officer under the Union of India, was not successfully proved.</li>
<li>In view of the above, the suit was dismissed.</li>
<li>The first appeal before the District Judge, Agra.</li>
<li>In appeal, under Order XLI Rule 27 CPC the Will executed by his maternal grandfather dated 1.3.1929 in his favour bequeathing the suit property was marked.</li>
<li>The First Appeal was allowed on conclusion that Maratha Government had made the gift of land in favour of plaintiff’s forefathers which was subsequently partitioned.</li>
<li>The registered partition deed stood duly proved and it was the proof of the title of the plaintiff.</li>
<li>The appellant UoI did not produce any document to show its title and failed to produce the original record, thus, adverse inference was drawn under Section 114 clause(g) of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872.</li>
<li>The Second Appeal was dismissed. Hence, the appeal before the Supreme Court.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Apex Court held –</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>It is not permissible to claim the relief of declaration without seeking consequential relief by virtue of the proviso of Section 34 of Specific Relief Act, 1963  (Relying on: Ram Saran v. Ganga Devi, AIR 1972 SC 2685, Vinay Krishna v. Keshav Chandra, AIR 1993 SC 957, Gian Kaur v. Raghubir Singh, (2011) 4 SCC 567).</li>
<li>There was nothing on record to show that Maratha Government had made a gift to the ancestors of the plaintiff.</li>
<li>A case not specifically pleaded can be considered by the court. The pleadings in substance contain the necessary averments to make out a particular case and issue has been framed on the point. In absence of pleadings, the court cannot make out a case not pleaded, suo motu (Bachhaj Nahar v. Nilima Mandal, AIR 2009 SC 1103 relied on). Hence the claim of title by virtue of the Will cannot be taken note of being not based on pleadings.</li>
<li>The Will had been executed prior to the birth of the plaintiff.  it could not have been taken into consideration without proper scrutiny of facts and, that too, without any pleading.</li>
<li>The rent note allegedly executed by the fore-fathers of the plaintiff. The said rent note does not provide any description of the property nor does it bear any date. The rent note does not provide any period at all. It could not be linked to prove the title.</li>
<li>UoI produced the certified copies of the Extract from General Land Register prepared on 15.3.1948 in support of its case and denying title of the plaintiff/respondent No.1.</li>
<li>The High Court rejected the same on the ground that the partition among the ancestors of the plaintiff had taken place prior to enactment of the Cantonment Land Administration Rules, 1925, though there is nothing on record to prove the said partition.</li>
<li>More so, the partition would not be a conclusive factor to determine the title of ownership.</li>
<li>The General Land Register maintained under the Cantonment Act, 1924 and the Rules made thereunder are public documents and the certified copies of the same are admissible in evidence in view of the provisions of Section 65 read with Section 74 of the Evidence Act.</li>
<li>It is settled legal position that the entries made in General Land Register maintained under Cantonment Land Administration Rules is conclusive evidence of title. (Vide: Chief Executive Officer v. Surendra Kumar Vakil, AIR 1999 SC 2294; and Union of India &amp; Ors. v. Kamla Verma, (2010) 13 SCC 511). The title of government cannot be disputed.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Apex Court allowed the appeal and held –</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>There was nothing on record to prove the grant/gift by the Maratha Government in favour of ancestors of plaintiff/respondent No.1 in the year 1800.</li>
<li>The alleged partition in the year 1819 even if had taken place, cannot be a proof of title.</li>
<li>Presumption under Section 90 of the Evidence Act in respect of 30 years’ old document coming from proper custody relates to the signature, execution and attestation of a document i.e. to its genuineness but it does not give rise to presumption of correctness of every statement contained in it.</li>
<li>If the Will was ignored, there was nothing on record to show as how the plaintiff  could claim the title. The truth of contents of a document have to be proved like any other fact.</li>
<li>The rent note did not prove anything.</li>
<li>The Will in absence of any pleading could not be taken on record. More so, the Will was not proved in accordance with law i.e. Section 68 of the Evidence Act.</li>
<li>The court cannot travel beyond the pleadings as no party can lead the evidence on an issue/point not raised in the pleadings and in case, such evidence has been adduced or a finding of fact has been recorded by the Court, it is just to be ignored.</li>
<li>Though it may be a different case where in spite of specific pleadings, a particular issue is not framed and parties having full knowledge of the issue in controversy lead the evidence and the court records a finding on it.</li>
<li>The first appellate court as well as the High Court recorded a finding that the Union of India failed to prove its title over the suit land. The said courts did not realise that this was not the issue to be determined, rather the issue had been as to whether the plaintiff was the owner of the suit land.</li>
