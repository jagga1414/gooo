<li>In Diala Ram v Sarga,  AIR 1927  Lahore 536, the plaintiff was a money-lender. The defendant was indebted to the plaintiff. He again took a loan from plaintiff and executed a bond agreeing to pay interest.

<li>In Sher Singh v.  Pirthi Singh, AIR 1975 All 259, an illiterate man of about 90 years, physically in firm and mentally in distress, executed a gift deed of his properties in favour of his nearest relative who was looking after him and managing his cultivation. The court held that donee was in a position to dominate the will of the donor.</li>
<li>In Krishna Mohan Kul @ Nani Charal Kul v. Pratima Maity, AIR 2003 SC 4351, the executant was more than 100 years of age at the time of alleged registration of the deed in question. He was paralytic and furthermore his mental and physical condition was not in order. He was also completely bed-ridden and though his left thumb impression was taken, there was no witness who could substantiate that he had put his thumb impression.</li>

<p><strong><u>Basic Principles of Pleading</u></strong></p>
<p><strong>Order VI, rule 1 and 2</strong> of Code of Civil Procedure 1908 lay down the basic principles of pleading. They read as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Rule 1:<strong> </strong><mark class="has-inline-color has-primary-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><strong><u>Pleading</u>: </strong>“Pleading” shall mean plaint or written statement.</mark></li>
<li>Rule 2:<strong> <mark class="has-inline-color has-primary-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><u>Pleading to state material facts and not evidence</u>:</mark></strong></li>
<li><mark class="has-inline-color has-primary-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">(1) Every pleading shall contain, and contain only a statement in a <strong><u>concise form of the material facts</u></strong> on which the party pleading relies for his claim or defence as the case may be, but not the evidence by which they are to be proved.</mark></li>
<li><mark class="has-inline-color has-primary-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">(2) Every pleading shall, when necessary, be divided into paragraphs, numbered consecutively, each allegation being, so far as is convenient, contained in a separate paragraph.</mark></li>
<li><mark class="has-inline-color has-primary-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">(3) Dates, sums and numbers shall be expressed in a pleading in figures as well as in words.</mark></li>
</ul>
<p><strong><u>Pleadings – <strong><u><mark class="has-inline-color has-foreground-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Particulars to be given where necessary</mark></u></strong></u></strong></p>
<p>Order 6 rule 4 of the Civil Procedure Code stipulates guidelines for precise pleadings. Order 6 Rule 4 CPC reads as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“Rule 4<strong>. </strong><mark class="has-inline-color has-primary-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><strong><u>Particulars to be given where necessary</u></strong>: In all cases in which the party pleading relies on any misrepresentation, fraud, breach of trust, willful default, or </mark><mark class="has-inline-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#1a06dd">undue influence</mark><mark class="has-inline-color has-primary-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"> and </mark><em><u><mark class="has-inline-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#a200db">in all other cases in which particulars may be necessary</mark></u></em><mark class="has-inline-color has-primary-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"> beyond such as are exemplified in the forms aforesaid, particulars (with dates and items if necessary) shall be stated in the pleading.”</mark></li>
</ul>
<p>Under Order 6 rule 4, CPC, vague or general allegations are insufficient in pleading with respect to the matters laid down in this rule<strong><sub>(f.n. 1)</sub></strong> and it requires ‘full‘ particulars of such matters in pleadings<strong><sub>(f.n. 2)</sub></strong>.</p>
<p><strong>“<u>All other cases in which particulars may be necessary</u>“</strong></p>
<p>Order 6 rule 4 of the CPC enumerates the following:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>misrepresentation,</li>
<li>fraud,</li>
<li>breach of trust,</li>
<li>willful default,</li>
<li><mark class="has-inline-color has-primary-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">undue influence</mark> and</li>
<li>“all other cases in which particulars may be necessary”.</li>
</ul>
<p>Following are the matters that commonly come for consideration of court under the head, “other cases in which particulars may be necessary”:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Injury,</li>
<li>Damages,</li>
<li>Illegality,</li>
<li>Collusion,</li>
<li>Victimisation,</li>
<li>Mala-fides,</li>
<li>Bias,</li>
<li>Unconstitutionality,</li>
<li>Trust,</li>
<li>Consent,</li>
<li>Irregularity.</li>
</ul>
<p>In short, in pleadings, wherever it is required to make clear ‘abstract’ propositions, it must have been done; otherwise it will be termed ‘vague pleading’.</p>
<p><strong><u>Guidelines for Precise Pleading</u></strong><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong> <mark class="has-inline-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#1a06dd">undue influence</mark></strong></span></p>
<p>From the above it is clear that, to attract <u>Sec. 16 of the Indian Contract Act</u>, there should be proper pleading [<mark class="has-inline-color has-foreground-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">particulars – with dates and items if necessary</mark>] as to-</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">

</ul>
<p><strong><u>Illegality</u></strong></p>
<p>While dealing with a matter pertaining to recount of votes, referring Apex Court decisions<strong><sub>(f.n.3),</sub> </strong>it was held in Indira Devi v. State of Bihar, 2019-1 Pat LJR 670, that the vague pleadings that illegality was committed while counting the ballot papers and that there were improper acceptance of invalid votes and improper rejection of valid votes, were not sufficient to invoke the jurisdiction of the court.</p>
<p><strong><u>Coercion</u></strong></p>
<p>When collusion is taken as a ground in a case, full particulars thereof are to be pleaded. In Varanaseya Sanskrit Vishwavidyalaya v. Rajkishore Tripathi, AIR 1977 SC 615, invoking Order VI, Rule 4, CPC and referring Bishundeo v. Seogeni Rai, AIR 1951 SC 280, it was held as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“General allegations are insufficient even to amount to an averment of <strong><u>fraud</u></strong> of which any court ought to take notice, however strong the language in which they are couched may be, and the same applies to <mark class="has-inline-color has-primary-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">undue influence</mark> and coercion.”</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><u>Fraud and Collusion</u></strong></p>
<p>While considering Order VI Rule 4 of CPC in K.S. Mariyappa v. K.R. Siddalinga Setty, AIR 1989 Kar 425, it was observed that in the absence of necessary particulars pleaded by the plaintiffs regarding fraud and collusion, it was not possible to hold that the plaint contains necessary averments as to fraud and collusion.</p>
<p><strong><u>If Insufficient Pleadings – No Investigation</u></strong></p>
<p>In Bishundeo Narain v. Seogeni Rai, AIR 1951 SC 280: 1951 SCR 548, it was observed as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“… In cases of fraud, <mark class="has-inline-color has-primary-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">undue influence</mark> and coercion, the parties pleading it must set forth full particulars and the case can only be decided on the particulars as laid. There can be no departure from them in evidence. General allegations are insufficient even to amount to an averment of fraud of which any court ought to take notice however strong the language in which they are couched may be and the same applies to <mark class="has-inline-color has-primary-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">undue influence</mark> and coercion.” : Quoted in Raja Ram v. Jai Prakash Singh, AIR 2019 SC 4374; 2019-8 SCC 701).</li>
</ul>
<p>In Kamalakanta Mohapatra Vs. Pratap Chandra Mohapatra, AIR 2010 Ori 13, it is held as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>The words “<mark class="has-inline-color has-primary-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">undue influence</mark>”, “fraud” and “misrepresentation” are cognate vices and may in part overlap in some cases, they are in law distinct categories and in view of Order 6, Rule 4 read with Order 6, Rule 2 of the Code of Civil Procedure required to be separately pleaded, with specificity, particularity and precision. In other words general allegations made in the plaint does not tantamount to particulars required to be pleaded under the said provision of the Code. … </li>
<li>In the case of <strong>Afsar Shaikh v. Soleman Bibi, reported in AIR 1976 SC 163</strong>, the Supreme Court has reiterated the same principle and had clearly held that in a case where there are allegations with regard to fraud, <mark class="has-inline-color has-primary-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">undue influence</mark> and misrepresentation the said allegation/facts must be specifically indicated in the pleadings. Keeping in mind the provision of Order 6, Rule 4 of the Code of Civil Procedure, if the averments made in the plaint are examined it reveals that the basic requirement of Order 6, Rule 4 of the Code of Civil Procedure was not kept in mind while making the allegations and the same appear to be more on the basis of surmises and conjectures rather than cogent facts.</li>
<li>So far as the nature of proof of <mark class="has-inline-color has-primary-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">undue influence</mark>, fraud or misrepresentation are concerned in he case of Balabhadra Nisanka v. Suka Dibya, reported in 38 (1972) CLT 325, it was held by this Court that ‘fraud’ in a civil proceeding must be established beyond reasonable doubt as in a criminal proceeding. So far as the evidence to establish fraud is concerned, it is held by this Court in the case of Bira Jena v. Tauli Dei, respondent in 38 (1972) CLT 39 : (AIR 1972 Ori 143) that unless the particulars of fraud are pleaded in the plaint, no evidence should be allowed to be led in the suit and if any such evidence has unwittingly been introduced without any pleading, it must be ruled out of consideration. In other words, the standard of proof to establish fraud should be beyond all reasonable doubt. After discussing the evidence threadbare the appellate Court had clearly come to a conclusion that the same does not satisfy the basic requirement of mandatory requirement of law. Even otherwise in the absence of pleadings, the evidence adduced had to be ignored.”</li>

<p>The Constitution Bench of the Supreme Court, in <strong> Laldi Parshad Jaiswal v. The Karnal Distillery Co. Ltd. Karnal, reported in AIR 1963 SC 1279</strong>, observed that under Order 6, Rule 4 of the Code of Civil Procedure, in all cases where a party takes a plea of <mark class="has-inline-color has-primary-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">undue influence</mark>, particulars thereof should be unambiguously stated in the pleadings so as to enable the adversary to controvert the same. A vague and general plea to that effect would not serve the purpose and the pleading must be always very specific and precise in nature. This rule has been evolved with a view to narrow down the controversy and protect the party charged with improper conduct from being taken by surprise. (See: Kamalakanta Mohapatra Vs. Pratap Chandra Mohapatra, AIR 2010 Ori 13). </p>
<p>The Supreme Court held in <strong>Ladli Parshad Jaiswal</strong> as under: </p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“The doctrine of ‘<mark class="has-inline-color has-primary-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">undue influence</mark>’ under the common law was evolved by the Courts in England for granting protection against transactions procured by the exercise of insidious forms of <mark class="has-inline-color has-primary-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">influence</mark> spiritual and temporal. The doctrine applies to acts of bounty as well as to other transactions in which one party by exercising his position of dominance obtains an unfair advantage over another. The Indian enactment is founded substantially on the rules of English common law. The first sub-section of S.16 lays down the principle in general terms. By sub-section (2) a <span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong><mark class="has-inline-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#b2059e">presumption</mark></strong></span> arises that a person shall be deemed to be in a position to dominate the will of another if the conditions set out therein are fulfilled. Sub-section (3) lays down the conditions for raising a rebuttable <span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong><mark class="has-inline-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#b2059e">presumption</mark></strong></span> that a transaction is procured by the exercise of <mark class="has-inline-color has-primary-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">undue influence</mark>. The reason for the rule in the <span style="text-decoration: underline">third sub-section is that a person who has obtained an advantage over another by dominating his will may also remain in a position to suppress the requisite evidence</span> in support of the plea of <mark class="has-inline-color has-primary-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">undue influence</mark>.” (Quoted in Joseph Johan Peter Sandy vs Veronica Thomas Rajkumar, AIR 2013 SC 2028)</li>

<p>In Subhash Chandra Das Mushib v. Ganga Prasad Das Mushib, AIR 1967 SC 878, it was held that the Court trying the case of <mark class="has-inline-color has-primary-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">undue influence</mark> must consider two things to start with, namely,</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>(1) are the relations between the donor and the donee, such that the donee is in a position to dominate the Will of the donor, and</li>
<li>(2) has the donee used that position to obtain an unfair advantage over the donor?</li>
<li>Upon the determination of these two issues a third point emerges, which is that of the onus probandi. </li>
</ul>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline">Merely because donor was old, no <span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong><mark class="has-inline-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#b2059e">presumption</mark></strong></span> of <mark class="has-inline-color has-primary-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">undue influence</mark></span></p>
<p>It is held further in <strong>Subhash Chandra Das Mushib v.

<p>In <strong>Afsar Shaikh v. Soleman Bibi</strong>, AIR 1976 SC 163, our Apex Court held:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“The law as to <mark class="has-inline-color has-primary-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">undue influence</mark> in the case of a gift inter vivos is the same as in the case of a contract. Sub-section (3) of Section 16 contains a rule of evidence. According to this rule, if a person seeking to avoid a transaction on the ground of <mark class="has-inline-color has-primary-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">undue influence</mark> proves-</li>
<li>(a) that the party who had obtained the benefit was, at the material time, in a position to dominate the will of the other conferring the benefit, and</li>
<li>(b) that the transaction is <mark class="has-inline-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#000adb"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">unconscionable</span></strong></mark>, the burden shifts on the party benefiting by the transaction to show that it was not induced by <mark class="has-inline-color has-primary-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">undue influence</mark>. If either of these two conditions is not established the burden will not shift. As shall be discussed presently, in the instant case the first condition had not been established; and consequently, the burden never shifted on the defendant. The Privy Council in Raghunath Prasad v. Sarju Prasad, (AIR 1924 PC 60) expounded three stages for consideration of a case of <mark class="has-inline-color has-primary-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">undue influence</mark>. It was pointed out that the first thing to be considered is, whether the plaintiff or the party seeking relief on the ground of <mark class="has-inline-color has-primary-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">undue influence</mark> has proved that the relations between the parties to each other are such that one is in a position to dominate the will of the other. Upto this point, ‘influence’ alone has been made out. Once that position is substantiated, the second stage has been reached – namely, the issue whether the transaction has been induced by <mark class="has-inline-color has-primary-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">undue influence</mark>. That is to say, it is not sufficient for the person seeking the relief to show that the relations of the parties have been such that the one naturally relied upon the other for advice, and the other was in a position to dominate the will of the first in giving it. Upon a determination of the issue at the second stage, a third point emerges, which is of the onus probandi. If the transaction appears to be <span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline"><mark class="has-inline-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#b100db">unconscionable</mark></span></strong></span>, then the burden of proving that it was not induced by <mark class="has-inline-color has-primary-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">undue influence</mark> is to lie upon the person who was in a position to dominate the will of the other. Error is almost sure to arise if the order of these propositions be changed. The <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline"><mark class="has-inline-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#b100db">unconscionab<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline"><mark class="has-inline-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#b100db">le</mark></span></strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">nes</span>s</mark></span></strong> of the bargain is not the first thing to be considered. The first thing to be considered is the relation of the parties. Were they such as to put one in a position to dominate the will of the other.”</li>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline">If facts justify, Omission (to make allegation of <mark class="has-inline-color has-primary-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">undue influence</mark>) is not fatal</span></p>
<p>In Joseph Johan Peter Sandy vs Veronica Thomas Rajkumar, AIR 2013 SC 2028, after quoting the above passage from Afsar Shaikh v. Soleman Bibi, AIR 1976 SC 163, it was observed as under:</p>

<p>Even if a person is in a fiduciary relationship with another and his conduct in looking after the other in <span style="text-decoration: underline">old age</span> may have <mark class="has-inline-color has-primary-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">influenced</mark> the thinking of the other, <span style="text-decoration: underline">that per se cannot lead to the only irresistible conclusio</span>n that the person was therefore in a position to dominate the will of the deceased.

<p>In <strong>Subhas Chandra Das Mushib v.

<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“It must also be noted that merely because the parties were nearly related to each other <span style="text-decoration: underline"><mark class="has-inline-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#392ef5">no <span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong><mark class="has-inline-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#b2059e">presumption</mark></strong></span></mark></span>  of <mark class="has-inline-color has-primary-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">undue influence</mark> can arise.

<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“It is a mistake (of which there are a good many traces in these proceedings) to treat <mark class="has-inline-color has-primary-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">undue influence</mark> as having been established by a proof of the relations of the parties having been such that the one naturally relied upon the other for advice and the other was in a position to dominate the will of the first in giving it. Up to that point “influence” alone has been made out. Such <mark class="has-inline-color has-primary-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">influence</mark> may be used wisely, judiciously and helpfully.

<li>“Before, however, a court is called upon to examine whether <mark class="has-inline-color has-primary-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">undue influence</mark> was exercised or not, it must scrutinise the pleadings to find out that such a case has been made out and that full particulars of <mark class="has-inline-color has-primary-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">undue influence</mark> have been given as in the case of fraud. See Order 6, Rule 4 of the Code of Civil Procedure. This aspect of the pleading was also given great stress in the case of Ladli Prasad Jaiswal v.

<p>In Krishna Mohan Kul @ Nani Charal Kul v.

The relevant passage reads as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“When fraud, misrepresentation or <mark class="has-inline-color has-primary-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">undue influence</mark> is alleged by a party in a suit, normally, the burden is on him to prove such fraud, <mark class="has-inline-color has-primary-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">undue influence</mark> or misrepresentation. But, when a person is in a fiduciary relationship with another and the letter is in a position of active confidence the burden of proving the absence of fraud, misrepresentation or <mark class="has-inline-color has-primary-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">undue influence</mark> is upon the person in the dominating position, he has to prove that there was fair play in the transaction and that the apparent is the real, in other words, that the transaction is genuine and bona fide. In such a case the burden of the proving the good faith of the transaction is thrown upon the dominant, party, that is to say, the party who is in a position of active confidence. A person standing in a fiduciary relation to another has a duty to protect the interest given to his care and the Court watches with jealousy all transactions between such persons so that the protector may not use his influence or the confidence to his advantage. <mark class="has-inline-color has-primary-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">When the party complaining <strong>shows such relation</strong>, the law <span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong><mark class="has-inline-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#b2059e">presums</mark></strong></span> everything against the transaction</mark> and the onus is cast upon the person holding the position of confidence or trust to show that the transaction is perfectly fair and reasonable, that no advantage has been taken of his position.</li>
<li>This principle has been engrained in Section 111 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 …. …..
