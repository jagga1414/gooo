<h1 class="wp-block-heading"><strong><mark class="has-inline-color has-primary-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Ancient History of Land of Kerala </mark></strong></h1>
<p>Ancient Kerala had a peculiar culture of its own. It experienced an isolated life, protected by the Western Ghats on east and Arabian Sea on west. This land of mountains and forest was divided by a good number of rivers. The term <em>Kerala</em> was first epigraphically recorded as <em>Ketalaputo</em> in a 3<sup>rd</sup> century BCE rock inscription by emperor Ashoka (Encyclopaedia Britannica &amp; Wikipedia).</p>
<p>The topographical situations made small and scattered villages with their own leaders or ‘Naduvazhis’ (Local Chiefs).  The people here collected Hill Produces and tried agriculture.  The calm gulf of Arabian Sea with favorable wind brought several merchants from Persian countries which were highly rich at that time.</p>
<p><strong><u>The Arian Invasion</u></strong></p>
<p>The Arian invasion from North India, through the eastern passages in Western Ghats, started in the 3<sup>rd</sup> century.  It made considerable change in the life and style of the people of medieval Kerala. By 8<sup>th</sup> century the Aryans made a complete change in the social scenario. Brahmins, the priestly class, predominated the emigrants.  They slowly caught hold of superiority in all fields of life. They were superior in intelligence, and people with ‘knowledge and experience’ in all walks of life. Brahmins made temples and attracted people there.</p>
<p><strong><u>Rise of <strong>Brahmin Janmies</strong></u></strong></p>
<p>Aryans subjugated the minds of the native people including the rulers and made them consider that Brahmins were the servants of the God and deity. They introduced paddy cultivation and led people do agriculture in a large scale.  The fascinating techniques taught by the Aryans miraculously increased the agricultural productivity. They succeeded in getting  lands endowed by the Rulers to the temples and Brahmins in the entire erstwhile Travancore, Cochin and Malabar areas. They also made people offer the agricultural produces, and part of their income, to the temple.  Temples were centers of collection of wealth. It also became the centers of distribution of food, and other articles.  They were centers of learning and art also.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration:underline">Devaswom Lands and Brahmaswom Lands</span></strong></p>
<p>The Kings and other ‘Naduvazhis’ relied on Brahmins to carry on their administration in a successful manner. Brahmins or their families became the administrators or ‘Ooralers’ of the temples.  Almost the entire cultivable lands were under the Devaswoms or temples (Devaswom lands) , and the Brahmin Janmies (Brahmaswom lands). A myth was rooted, by passage of time, in the minds of people, that this land was one reclaimed by Parasurama from Arabian Sea and that he entrusted this land to Brahmins. It was also believed that Parasurama was a great warrior and that he conquered this land and appointed Brahmins as the territorial lords.  Slowly, the Aryans, who monopolised the whole of the land, began to rule the territory, directly or indirectly.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration:underline">Jenmom lands and <u>Exalted p</u></span><u>osition of Brahmins</u></strong></p>
<p>The Brahmins and prominent Nairs were the territorial lords. The owners of these lands were called Jenmies; and the lands belonged to them were known as Jenmom lands. The Sirkar (King) was the greatest Jenmi. Apart from original Jenmom lands, the rulers and the King obtained land by gift, purchase, escheat, confiscation etc.</p>
<p>The exalted position of Brahmins in the society increased day by day, during the medieval period.  A major portion of the cultivable land remained under the ‘Janmam’ of Brahmins. </p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">Malabar and Chera Kingdom</span></strong></p>
<p>Malabar was used to denote entire costal land from Goa to Kanyakumari, in ancient times, until the British limited it to the portion of land confined to northern part of present Kerala. During ‘Middle Ages’, till 12<sup>st</sup> century, entire Malabar remained under Chera Kingdom (from 9<sup>th</sup> Century). After breaking up of this Kingdom, the chieftains of the respective region proclaimed their political independence. They included the Zamorins of Calicut and Kolathiri; rulers of  <em>Perumbadappu Swaroopam (Later, Kingdom of Cochin)</em>,  Naduvazhis of Venad, Valluvanad etc.</p>
<p>The land-scenario heftily changed on the advent of Dutch (1663–1773) and English (1773- 1947). The permanent settlement (fix revenue to be raised from land) was introduced by the British Government in the Malabar area in 1802. It obligated the jenmis to pay revenue to the State.  But did not in any way affect their proprietary rights in the lands. (Balmadies Plantations Ltd. v. The State of Tamil Nadu, AIR 1972 SC 2240; Thressiamma Jacob v.  Geologist, Dptt. of Mining, 2013 (9) SCC 725).</p>

<p>The powerful King, Marthandavarma who ruled Travancore from 1729 to 1758, was successful in bringing all people and properties of Travancore (Southern Kingdom at present Kerala) under his administration; and collected tax from all lands except those that were expressly exempted.</p>
<p>The King of Travancore placed himself as the servant of the deity. The entire assets of Travancore were regarded as the property that belonged to the Treasury or Offertory (Bhandaram in Malayalam; Pandaram in Tamil) of the Principal deity – Sree Padmanabha Swamy Temple at Thiruvanamthapuram.</p>

The MahaRajah having next ordered Rama Iyen Dalawah to frame regular accounts and rules for fixing permanent taxes on lands and gardens, that official commenced a survey of them in 926 M.E.

<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“4. Before proceeding to consider the legal issues raised and the jurisdiction of the lower courts and that of this Court which are also issues raised before us based on Article 363 of the Constitution, we have to briefly state the history of the Sree Padmanabha Swamy Temple. Even though the origin of the Temple is shrouded in antiquity and different versions are stated by different Authors, the modern history of this Great Temple starts with Anizham Thirunal Marthandavarma who established the modern Travancore State which was previously known as Venad. For over 200 years prior to the re-establishment of the Princely State and taking over of management of the Temple and the State by Marthandavarma, the Temple was under the control of “Ettarayogam” (group of eight and a half) consisting of seven pottis (Brahmins), one Nair chieftain and the King who had only half a vote, whereas all others had one vote each. While the committee of Potties controlled the Temple, the properties of the Temple were managed by Ettuveettil Pillamars, the 8 Nair chieftains belonging to eight big families spread over in different villages of the State. The King was a low key functionary in the Committee managing the Temple and he had only a very limited authority with half a vote……</li>
<li>The Ettuveettil Pillamars with the help of Brahmins in management of the Temple plotted against Marthandavarma becoming the King and they tried to instal the previous King’s son as the new King in deviation of the practice of the nephew of the King namely, Marthandavarma becoming the King. However, in the protracted battle that followed between the heir to the throne namely, Marthandavarma and his loyalists on the one side and the Ettuveettil Pillamars, the Brahmins, and the King’s son’s loyalists on the other side, Marthandavarma succeeded……</li>
<li>Marthandavarma took over full control of the State and the Padmanabha Swamy Temple and it is he who reconstructed the Temple which was in bad shape after a major fire that took place years back and installed a new idol. </li>
<li>In fact the King surrendered his Kingdom to the presiding Deity namely, Padmanabha Swamy and declared himself the Dasa or servant of the Lord and assumed the name “<strong>Padmanabhadasa</strong>“. Marthandavarma ruled Travancore from 1729 to 1758 and after him also the Temple continued to be under the direct management and control of the King.</li>

<li>“<span style="text-decoration: underline">Thrippati Danam</span> – 5th of Makaram 925-ME/1750 AD Fifth Makaram 925 ME/19th or 20th January 1750 AD (Wednesday asterism Revait) stood witness to the act of a sublime dedication, the ultimate offering possible for a crowned head, carried out in supreme devotion – the Thrippati Danam. [Many historical works (too many to be listed).]  Like Arjuna before the Kurukshetra War and Emperor Ashoka after the Kalinga War, the futility of battles as a means to an end and the conscious feeling that the Travancore he created was built on a foundation of sacrifice of the liver and limbs of countless numbers who fell due to him and for him, deeply disturbed and distressed the Maharaja [Sree Uthradom Thirunal Marthanda Varma]. Along with the love which offered Marthanda Varma no satiation however much he might submit to his Lord, this trauma also activated him to surrender to God the Thiruvithamcoor (Travancore) stretching from Kanyakumari to Paravoor which he had won and made.</li>
<li>Before this dedication certain religious ceremonies like Poorna Kalasa Homam, invoking the Deity, and so on were performed, followed later by Mahabhishekam.</li>
<li>Maharaja Anizhom Thirunal Marthanda Varma arrived at the appointed time in the morning accompanied by all male and female members of his family, his trusted Dewan Ramayyan and other officials. In the presence of the Swamiyar, members of the yogam and Brahmins, the Maharaja is submitted to Sree Padmanabha Prajapati by Deed of Gift carrying his signature, his entire State of Travancore along with his total right on it thereof by placing the Crown, the royal umbrella, the twin white chauries (fans), the Manikandha; which were all symbols of royalty along with some Thulasi leaves on the Mandapam. Last but most significant, his famous sword, which had lashed its unleashed valour in countless battle fields, the unquestioned insignia of sovereign authority which the King valued the most, was also placed with utmost reverence by the Maharaja on the step of the Ottakkal Mandapam leading to the sanctum. Then the King received the sword back from the high priest and returned to the Palace after worship. His directive that any further conquest of territory brought under the rule of Travancore by his successors should also be surrendered to Sree Padmanabha Swamy was accepted and scrupulously adhered to with deep respect by the later generations.”</li>
<li>The English Translation of the Original Deed of Dedication which was drawn up in Malayalam is as under:-</li>
<li>“We, Thrippappoor Keezhperur Veera Bala Marthanda Varma, Mootha Thiruvati (Senior member) of Thrippappoor and <strong><u>Sree Pandarakaryam Cheyvarkal</u></strong>, have this day, Wednesday the 5th day of the month of Thai, the seventh day of the bright lunar fortnight with Saturn residing in the eighth sign and Jupiter in the twelfth, Kollam 925, transfer by absolute gift and dedication, to endure as long as the Sun and Moon shall last, all the lands and functions appertaining thereto together with all rights and dignities, positions of honour and all other possessions that we have been hitherto enjoying as of right within the territories between the Thovala Fort in the East and the Kavana River in the West, in favour of Perumal Sree Padmanabha Perumal.

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline">‘Kettezhuthu’ and Kandezhuthu’</span></p>
<p>First attempt to make a settlement in Travancore was in 1712.  It was on ‘Kettezhuthu’ (what is heard) basis; i.e., on discussions with landholders. Pattas were issued after the settlement. In 1775 a complete survey was conducted on ‘Kandezhuthu’ (what is seen) basis. Pattas were issued to the holders on this basis also. Complete resurvey of garden lands was conducted in 1836. This time measurements were made with the scale if a 10-Feet-Rod. Pattas were issued this time also.</p>
<p>The last settlement of Travancore was during 1882 to 1909. The survey thereon was commenced in 1885 and finalised in 1910.</p>

<p>They did not derive their title to lands from any King or Sircar; and it was considered as an ‘inherent right’.

<li><strong><u>“6. LAND TENURES</u></strong></li>
<li>Till a century ago, the State presented an interesting (though from the point of view of economicdevelopment, far too complex) system of land tenures derived from Land Tenures the peculiar conditions of its historical development. They have been considerably simplified by several pieces of land-tenure legislation.</li>
<li>The chief categories of tenure· in this district may be broadly classified:-</li>
<li>.<strong>I. (a) Pandaravaka.</strong> These (comprising three-fourths of the total area of the State and including the vast majority of holdings) are <span style="text-decoration: underline">lands belonging to the Sirkar or government.</span> All tenants are now practically owners of their land, subject to payment of tax. </li>
<li><strong>(b) Kandukrishi lands.</strong> They are the <span style="text-decoration: underline">home-farm lands of the Maharaja of Travancore</span>. </li>
<li><strong>(c) Sripandaravaka lands</strong> (extent, 28,000 acres). These are lands belonging to the <span style="text-decoration: underline">temple of Sri Padmanabhaswami </span>in Trivandrum and lie scattered in the various taluks of this district. </li>
<li><strong>(d) Sripadam lands</strong>-(area about 15,000 acres). These, lying in the pakuthies of Edakkodu and Attingal in the Chirayinkil taluk, are the <span style="text-decoration: underline">private property of the Maharaja of Travancore.</span> In all government lands, the system of land-tenures is based on· the ryot-wari principle, i. e . direct settlement with individual ryots.</li>
<li><strong>II. Jenmom lands</strong>. They are the <span style="text-decoration: underline">absolute private property</span> of the owners. Under the Jenmikudiyan Acts, ryots holding jenmom lands have been given fixity of tenure, the dues to the jenmi being collected and paid to them by government the collection being made along with the land-tax.</li>
<li>The chief systems of tenancy under which tenants hold lands owned by others are: </li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline">I. Verumpattom (venpattom).</span> They are tenants who hold lands on lease for periods and on -conditions, stated in the contract; they are liable to be evicted under the conditions of the contract. </li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline">II-Varamdars (Pankuvaramdars)</span>. They are people who’ raise crops ron agricultural lands <em>in </em>partnership with the owners of the land; the conditions of partnership vary in different localities.</li>
<li><strong>III-Kudikidappukar</strong>. They are persons who were previously allow.ed by the owners of the land to occupy a small portion of it, generally to put up a small house to live in and watch the land or work on it.</li>
<li><strong>IV -Otti (Mortgages).</strong> Tenancy under this head take different forms in different regions. The question of giving fixity of tenure to cultivating tenants is under consideration. It may be stated that the ratio of cultivating tenants to non-cultivating owners of land in this district is 4: 1.</li>

<p>During the second half of 18<sup>th </sup>century the lands in Travancore and  Cochin were brought under the Government administration and these lands were called Sircar or Pandaravaka lands.  In certain places local chiefs (Nadu-vazhis) were ’emerged’.  </p>
<p>On emergence of the Sircar and Ndu-vazhies, the they<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline"> were considered as the janmi</span></strong> of those lands belonged to them (got under gift, purchase, escheat, confiscation and other ways – See: Travancore Land Revenue Manual – IV). Regarding Pandaravaka lands it is stated in the Travancore Land Revenue Manual as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“<span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Pandaravaka</strong> or <strong>Sircar lands</strong> are lands of which the</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline">State is the landlord</span> or the Jenmi and whatever rights which vest in the ryots are (that) derived from the Sircar.”</li>

<ul class="wp-block-list">

About three- fourths of the whole land in the State belong on Janmam to the Sircar, the remaining one-fourth being distributed among the classes mentioned in para 32 It is interesting to note that in certain parts of Madras Janmam rights existed ‘and the ‘Government lands were called government janman lands.</li>
<li>(See Government Order No. 1902 Revenue dated November 1, 1926) Para 3 of that order deals with the janmam estates and reads as under:</li>

The <span style="text-decoration: underline">origin of the title of the jenmies is shrouded in obscurity</span> but the development of this branch of land tenure was on the assumption that <span style="text-decoration: underline">Parasurama who conquered the land of Kerala </span>or, as mythology would put it, reclaimed it from the sea, gave it as gift to Malayala Brahmins or Nambudiries. The rest of the people cultivated the lands under the Jenmies. <span style="text-decoration: underline">In course of time, the Jenmies endowed certain temples built by them with lands and thus the <strong>Devaswom lands</strong> came into existence</span>.

</ul>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">The concept of Classification of Lands</span></strong></p>
<p>The concept of classification of lands emerged in 2<sup>nd </sup>half of the 19<sup>th</sup> century in Travancore and Cochin. The lands were classified under 8 heads in the Travancore Land Revenue Manual, Volume III (1915).  They were –</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">

<li>The revenue from these lands fell under the head, ‘Ayacut’ or ‘Settled Revenue’.</li>

<p>Our Apex Court in Kannan Devan Hills Produce Company Ltd. v. State of Kerala, AIR 1972 SC 2301, 1972-2 SCC 218, held as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“In the Travancore Land Revenue Manual, Vol. III, Revised Edition, 1936, Registered Lands are described as follows 
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“<strong>Registered lands</strong> are lands registered in the revenue accounts as held by or granted to individuals, families, corporations or institutions, and comprise all the different kinds of tenures bearing either the full assessment or wholly or partially free of assessment.

</ul>
</li>
<li>The Registered Lands include inter alia, (a) <strong>Pandaravaka lands</strong> and (b) <strong>Janmam lands</strong>. Regarding Pandaravaka lands it is stated :

<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">‘Jenmom’ was proprietary interest</span></strong> <span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>with Liability to Pay Tax (Freehold</strong></span>)</p>
<p>The concepts on ‘janmam’ continued even after introduction of Tax system by Government. ‘Jenmom’ was taken the proprietary interest of a landlord in lands (Kavalappara Kottarathil Kochuni v. States of Madras and Kerala, AIR 1960 SC 1080).  Subba Rao, J., observed as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">

<li>Moor in his “Malabar Law and Custom” describes it as a hereditary proprietorship. A janmam interest may, therefore, be described as  “<strong>proprietary interest of a landlord in lands</strong>” and such a janmam right is described as “estate” in the Constitution. Substituting “janmam right” in place of “estate” in cl. 2 (b), the “rights” in <strong>Art. 31 A (1) (a)</strong> will include the rights of a proprietor and subordinate tenure-holders in respect of a janmam right. </li>
<li>It follows that the extinguishment or modification of a right refers to the rights of a proprietor or a subordinate tenure-holder in the janmam right. <span style="text-decoration: underline">A proprietor called the janmi </span>or his subordinate tenure-holder has certain defined rights in janmam right”.  Land-tenures in Malabar are established by precedents or immemorial usage. <span style="text-decoration: underline">Janmam right is a <strong>freehold interest</strong> in property</span> and the landlord is called  “janmi”. He can create many subordinate interests or tenures therein.” (Quoted in: Kannan Devan Hills Produce v.  The State of Kerala, AIR 1972 SC 2301)</li>

<p>In the Jenmi and Kudiyan Regulation, V of 1071 (1896), Jenmom land is defined as-</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“land (other than Pandaravaka, Sripandaravaka, Kandukrishi or Sircar Devaswom land, recognised as such in the Sircar accounts) which is either entirely exempt from Government tax or if assessed to public revenue, is subject to Rajabhogam only, and the occupancy right in; which is created for a money consideration (Kanom) and is also subject to the payment of Michavaram or customary dues and the payment of the renewal fees.”</li>

<p>The Travancore Jenmi and Kudiyan Act, V of 1071 (1896), defines ‘Jenmi’ as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>” ‘Jenmi’ means a person in whom the proprietary right over Jenmom lands is vested and includes, in the case of Devaswoms owning Jenmom lands, the managing Trustee or Trustees of the Institution for the time being.”</li>

<p>In Padmanabharu Govindaru  v. The State of Kerala, AIR 1963 Ker 86, it was observed with respect to the ‘Janmi’ as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“What the definition stresses is the <strong>proprietary right</strong> in the land. We may in this connection extract a passage from the Memorandum of Mr. Kunhiraman Nair, one of the Judges of the High Court of Travancore, about 70 years ago:</li>
<li>“The term ‘Jenmom’ was originally used by the Brahmins exclusively to denote their allodial proprietorship and is still used in that sense in courts and cutcherries in Travancore, though in other parts of Malayalam and in popular parlance in Travancore, the term is now universally employed to denote the full proprietary right in the land of any class of people”.</li>

<p>1. <strong><u>The Government Grants Act, 1895</u></strong></p>
<p>The Government Grants Act, 1895 (known as ‘Crown Grants Act, 1895’), had been enacted with a view to secure the Govt. lands from potential or protracted legal claims. It applies to erstwhile Malabar area of Kerala (part of former Madras State).</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline">The <u>Government Grants Act, 1895</u> reads as under</span>:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>1. <strong><u>Title and extent</u></strong>.-(1) This Act may be called the Government Grants Act, 1895.</li>
<li>(2) It extends to the whole of India except the territories which, immediately before the 1st November, 1956 , were comprised in Part B States.</li>

<p>2. <strong><u>Government Lands Grants Act, 1940 (Cochin)</u></strong></p>
<p>The Government Lands Grants Act, 1940 (enacted with the same words to effect restrictions as that of the Government Grants Act, 1895)  made constraints in the ‘<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">grant <mark class="has-inline-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#161feb">or other transfer </mark>of land</span> or of any interest therein</strong> <span style="text-decoration: underline">heretofore made or hereafter to be made by or on behalf of the Government</span> to, or in favour of, any person whomsoever’.  By virtue of this Act also, Transfer of Property Act and Tenancy Acts did not to apply to lands given as grant by the Government.</p>
<p>3. <strong><u>Kerala Grants and Leases (Modification of Rights) Act, 1980</u></strong></p>
<p>Kerala Grants and Leases (Modification of Rights) Act, 1980 was enacted with a view to modify the rights under grants and leases, for cultivation, made by the former States of Travancore and Cochin. The Act was made for the reason that such grants and leases brought about heavy loss to the Government and they resulted in huge un-earned profits to the grantees and lessees; and it was found necessary in the public interest that such undue profits to a few person were to be utilised for the common benefit of the general public.</p>

<p>In the following cases the effect of “grant” by the Erstwhile Governments was considered.</p>
<p>1. <strong><u>Kannan Devan Hills Produce <strong><u>Co. Ltd.</u></strong></u></strong> <strong><u>v.  The State of Kerala, AIR 1972 SC 2301</u></strong></p>
<p>The Supreme Court, in Kannan Devan Hills Produce v. The State Of Kerala, AIR 1972 SC 2301 (Sikri (Cj), Shelat, A.N. Ray, I.D.

<p>According to the <strong><u>petitioner Company,</u></strong><u> ‘</u>it has at all times been holding, cultivating, enjoying and dealing with the Concession Land as the <strong><u>absolute, owner</u></strong> thereof’.</p>
<p><mark class="has-inline-color has-foreground-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">According to the State, this land is dealt with under this heading – </mark><strong><mark class="has-inline-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#cf2e2e">Pandaravaka Lands<strong>, i.e. lands belonging to the Sircar</strong></mark></strong><mark class="has-inline-color has-foreground-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><strong>.</strong></mark> and that it was only “granted” to the company for ‘coffee cultivation’. It asserted –</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>that the petitioner Company was not an absolute owner, but only a lessee under the Government, especially since the 1899 Proclamation issued by H.H. the Maharaja declaring that Kannan Devan Hills was ‘an integral part’ of the ‘territory’.</li>
<li>that the petitioner’s predecessor-in-title was <strong>John Danial Munro</strong>, who obtained, the <strong><u>first Pooniat Concession</u></strong> from <strong><u>Punjar Valiya Raja</u></strong>, on July 11, 1877. This Concession recited that an, application was made for the <strong><u>grant</u></strong> of the above property to the Raja for coffee cultivation.</li>
<li>It was further stipulated in the Concession that
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li> “you shall clear and remove the jungles, and reclaim the waste lands within the said boundaries, and cultivate them with coffee up to the year 1058 and from the year 1059, pay our <strong>rent</strong> collector a yearly rent at the rate of 3,000 British Rupees.”</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong><u>H.H. the Maharaja executed a deed of ratification</u></strong>, dated November 28, 1878, by which the Government <strong><u>ratified</u></strong> the First Pooniat Concession dated July 11, 1877.</li>
<li>This <strong><u>deed of ratification</u></strong> laid down –  the Government permitted the grantee to <strong><u>hold</u></strong> the land. (it is similar to the ‘Grant/Title’ deeds executed by the State in all other ‘Grants’ – under the ‘Grant Rules’).</li>
<li><strong><u>Clause 5</u></strong> of the Deed of Ratification, is important. It provides, inter alia, that
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“The grantee can appropriate to his own use within the limits of the grant all timber except the following and such as may hereafter be reserved namely, Teak, Cole Teak, Blackwood, Ebony, Karoonthaly, Sandalwood; should he carry any timber without the limits of the grant it will be subject to the payment of Kooteekanom, or Customs Duty……….</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong><u>The eleventh clause</u></strong> reads – “The land granted shall be held in perpetuity as heritable or transferable property, but every case of transfer of the grant by the grantee shall be immediately made known to the Sircar, who shall have the right of apportioning the tax, if a portion of the holding is transferred.”</li>
<li><strong><u>The twelfth clause</u></strong> stipulates – “The discovery of useful mines and treasures within the limits of the grant shall be communicated to the Sircar, and the grantee shall in respect to such mines and treasures, abide by the decision of the Sircar.”</li>
<li><strong><u>The sixteenth clause</u></strong> provides – “The grantee shall be bound to preserve the forest trees growing on the banks of the principal streams running through the tract to the extent of fifty yards in breadth on each side of the stream, the Underwood only being permitted to be cleared and coffee planted instead. Similarly he shall also be bound to preserve the, trees about the crest of the hill to the extent of a quarter of a mile on each side.”</li>
<li>A <strong><u>Royal Proclamation was made on September 24, 1899</u></strong> provided that ‘Anjanad and Kannan Devan Hills is an integral portion of our territory and that the inhabitants of the said tract are ‘hereby informed and warned that they are not to pay any taxes, rents or dues, or make any other payment to the Poonjar Chief.</li>
</ul>
<p>Points came for consideration were the following:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Whether the Kannan Devan Hills (Resumption of Lands) Act, 1971 was protected from challenge under Art. 31A of the Constitution. That is, whether these lands fall within expression ‘Janmam right’ or “estate”  in art. 31A of the Constitution.</li>
<li>If the lands acquired were an “estate”, or with ‘Janmam right’ owned by the Company, the land reform enactment did not have stood valid. (Note: Kesavananda Bharathi Case came in 1973.)</li>
</ul>
<p>The Apex Court found the following:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>The janmam rights (even if remained with the Poonjar Chief, H.H. the <strong>Maharaja became the janmi by the Royal proclamation of 1899.</strong></li>
<li>The nature of ‘janmam right’ has been examined by this Court previously in Kavalappara Kottarathil Kochuni v. State of Madras [1960] 3 S.C.R. 887 Subba Rao, J., observed that janmam right in Kerala is an “estate and it <strong>is the freehold interest.</strong></li>
<li>The <strong>Sircar itself is one of these janmis and it was the largest Janmi</strong>. It came to possess janmam lands by gift, purchase, escheat, confiscation and other ways</li>
<li>If any person wants land in Travancore, he must obtain it from, some one of the body of Janmis, i.e. from the Sircar, which is the Chief Janmi, or from some other Janmi.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Apex Court observed as under: </p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“… On the material placed before us it is difficult to resist the conclusion that the lands in dispute fall within the expression “Janmam right”. </li>
<li>If, as stated in Travancore Land Revenue Manual Volume IV, there are <span style="text-decoration: underline">no lands that do not belong to a Janmi </span>and the <span style="text-decoration: underline">Sircar becomes a janmi</span> by gift, escheat confiscation or otherwise, the effect of the Royal Proclamation of 1899 must be that the Sircar became the Janmi.”</li>
</ul>
<p>The Apex Court further found –</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>The Registered Lands included inter alia, (a) Pandaravaka lands and (b) Janmam lands.</li>
<li>Regarding Pandaravaka lands it is stated : “<strong>Pandaravaka or Sircar lands</strong> are, lands of which the State is the landlord or the Jenmi and whatever rights which vest in the ryots are derived from the Sircar.”</li>
<li>Kenan Devan Hills Concession is dealt with under this heading, i.e. Pandaravaka Lands.</li>
<li><u>It thus appears that the</u> <strong>State <u>grants </u></strong><u>like Kanan Devan Hills</u> Concession and Ten Square Miles Concession, and Munro Lands, <strong>were </strong>treated under the heading <u>‘Pandaravaka Lands</u>, i.e.<strong> lands belonging to the Sircar</strong> (that is, such Grant-lands were <strong>not ‘owned’ by the holders</strong> thereof).</li>
</ul>
<p>On these findings The Apex Court upheld the Kannan Devan Hills (Resumption of Lands) Act, 1971 and dismissed the challenge of the Company.</p>
<p>2. <strong><u>State of Kerala v. Kanan Devan Hills Produce Co. Ltd., (1991) 2 SCC 272</u></strong></p>
<p>With respect to the same property  it was held in State of Kerala v. Kannan Devan Hills Produce Co. Ltd., (1991) 2 SCC 272<strong>, </strong>as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“The Trial Court in a detailed and well-reasoned judgment dismissed the suit of the company. <strong><u>The Trial Court </u></strong>on the interpretation of First Concession (Exhibit P- 1), Second Concession (Exhibit P-2), deed of ratification (Exhibit P-62) and the Government agreement with the Society dated August 2, 1866 (Exhibit P-64) <strong><u>came to the conclusion </u></strong>that the <strong>company did not</strong> <strong><u>acquire</u></strong> <strong>absolute proprietary rights</strong> <strong>over the Concession Area</strong> or the trees and timber in the said area. It was held that the Poonjar Chief had only conveyed heritable and transferable possessory rights over the Concession area to the grantee. It was also held that absolute rights over the trees and timber in the Concession Area did not pass to the <strong>grantee</strong> and it had only the right to use and remove timber subject to the restrictions imposed in the deeds of conveyance/ratification.”</li>
</ul>
<p>It is observed:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“An identical clause in another grant entered into by the Travancore Government came for consideration before a Full Bench of the Kerala High Court in <strong>George A Leslie v. State of Kerala, [1969] K. L.T. 378,</strong> K. K. Mathew, J. (as the learned Judge then was) interpreted the clause as under: 
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><em>“</em> We think that if title to the reserved trees passed to the grantees, a provision of this nature would have been quite unnecessary. <span style="text-decoration: underline">There was no purpose in stating that the grantees will be free to appropriate the reserved trees</span> for consumption within the limits of the grant,<span style="text-decoration: underline"> if title to the trees passed to the grantees</span>; the provision is a clear indication that the grantees were allowed to cut and appropriate the reserved trees for consumption within the limits of the grant as a matter of concession.”</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>“We agree with the interpretation given to the clause by Mathew, J. and <strong>hold that the respondent- company <span style="text-decoration: underline">did not acquire absolute proprietary rights </span>over the Concession Area or the trees and the timber therein</strong>.”</li>
</ul>
<p>It is observed further:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“It was further held by Mathew, J. (in George A. Leslie v. State of Kerala, 1969 KLT 378) that kuttikanam being the <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">governments </span><u>share</u></strong> of the value of the trees owned by the government it has the power to fix the value of the trees. We agree with the reasoning and conclusions reached by Mathew, J.”</li>
</ul>
<p>The Apex Court upheld and approved “the judgment and findings” of the Trial Court.</p>

<li>“Ext. P-l is a grant made under the Travancore Regulation II of 1040 and the Rules for the sale of Waste Land on the Travancore Hills dated 24th April <strong>1865.</strong> It conferred a heritable and transferable interest in the grantees of the land comprised in it. <span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Clause 5 </strong>in Ext.

</ul>
</li>

</ul>
<p>4. <strong><u>Thomas Philip v. Forest Range Officer</u></strong> – <strong>1923 ‘Grant’ of Travancore Government</strong></p>
<p>Grant made by the Travancore Government, in 1923 was considered in <strong>Thomas Philip v. Forest Range Officer, </strong>2021-2 KerLT 578. The Chief Secretary to the Government of Travancore <strong><u>‘granted’</u></strong> land ‘<strong><u>for coffee or tea cultivation’</u></strong>. The fifth condition read as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“The full right to Royal trees within the grant is reserved and continues to vest in the Government. The Grantee shall be bound to take care of the Royal trees particularised in column 5 of the schedule hereunder written until they are removed or otherwise disposed of by the Government. The Grantee shall also be bound to deliver to the Government all ivory found and other Royalties produced in the land, and all captured elephants, and will be paid the regulated price for the articles of produce, and the regulated reward for the elephant, at the discretion of the Government.”</li>
</ul>
<p>It was contended that the ‘ownership’ of the land was purchased by the petitioner’s father in 1941. He planted trees. The petitioner made an application in 2006 to the Forest Range Officer seeking NOC for felling rosewood trees and teak wood trees. It was denied in view of the fifth condition of title deed to the effect that the full right over all the trees in the properties were fully vested with the Government<strong>. The <u>petitioner argued that the 1923 deed is not a grant, but a title deed.</u></strong> The Government Pleader argued that the property held by the petitioner is a grant which would come under the purview of the Kerala Grants and Leases (Modification of Rights) Act, 1980. In view of the said Act, 1980, the appropriation of teak, Blackwood, etc. were subject to payment of seigniorage at the rates specified. Section 4(1) of the Kerala Grants and Leases (Modification of Rights) Act, 1980, reads as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“4. <strong><u>Grantees and lessees to pay</u></strong> current <strong>seigniorage</strong> rates- (1) Notwithstanding anything contained in any law for the time being in force, or in any grant, lease deed, contract or agreement, or in any judgment, decree or order of any court, with effect on and from the commencement of this Act, every grantee and every lessee shall be bound to pay to the Government the seigniorage rates in force for the time being for the timber cut and removed from any land held by him under the grant or lease.”</li>
</ul>
<p>On the basis of <strong>Jose v. State of Kerala, </strong>2020 (2) KLT 560 and <strong>Manoj A.N. v. State of Kerala </strong>2013 (3) KLT 649, it was argued for the State that the trees  came into existence subsequent to the assignment was also covered by the Act.</p>
<p>Relying on <strong>Gopi v. Tahsildar, </strong>2002 (3) KLT 526, and  <strong>Majeed v. State of Keral</strong>a, 2006 (1) KLT 19, it was contended that that the <strong>rights obtained in terms of <u>1923 grant was not absolute</u></strong>. (The Government Pleader also relied on two unreported judgments – in W.P.(C) No. 804/2006 and Crl. M.C. No. 7347/2017).</p>
<p>The petitioner argued that the restriction was only in respect of the trees made mention in 1923 title deed and the trees sought to be cut and removed by the petitioner are those planted by the father of the petitioner. The Court held as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“But, the fifth condition quoted above would show that the grantee is bound to deliver to the Government other royalties produced in the land also and Government is expected to pay regulated price for the articles of produce. The term ‘other royalties produced’ would indeed include subsequently planted royal trees also…..</li>
<li>In view of sub-section (1) of Section 4 and the non-obstante clause therein, the petitioner is liable to pay <strong><u>seigniorage</u></strong> for the trees proposed to be cut and removed by him. The fifth condition in Ext.P1 (1923) will stand modified to the extent provided under Section 4(1) of the Act, 1980.”</li>
</ul>
<p>The High Court concluded analysing the Ext. P1 (1923) Title Deed, Kerala Grants and Leases (Modification of Rights) Act, 1980, Kerala Preservation of Trees Act, 1986 and Kerala Promotion of Tree Growth on Non-Forest Areas Act, 2005 as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>.(1) The fifth condition in Ext.

<li>(2) For cutting, uprooting or burning any tree falling within the definition of tree as contained in Section 2(e) of the Kerala Preservation of Trees Act, 1986, it is necessary to obtain previous permission of the Authorised Officer.</li>
<li>(3) Notwithstanding anything contained in any other law, except in respect of trees:

<p>5. <strong><u>Padmanabharu Govindaru  v. The State of Kerala</u></strong>– <strong><u> Coffee Planter under a Grant </u>is<u> not a Jenmi</u></strong></p>
<p>Following passage from Sri T. Madhava Row’s Memorandum (Travancore Land Revenue Manual) regarding the origin and nature of Jenmom rights is quoted in the Judgment (<strong>Padmanabharu Govindaru  v. The State of Kerala, AIR 1963 Ker 86</strong>). Sri T. Madhava Row stated as under: </p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“A Jenmi is often termed a landlord. But, it must be clearly  understood and also always remembered that a Jenmi though certainly a landlord, is a peculiar Kind or landlord. Any person, who holds a pattah from a Collector in a British District and under it holds from the British Government subject to Government tax more or less, is called a landlord in ordinary language. </li>
<li>Even in Travancore, any <strong>coffee planter</strong> or indeed any ryot, who holds lands <strong>under a grant </strong>from the Sirkar, etc. , is or may be called a landlord. But, be it remembered, such landlords are <strong>not Jenmies</strong>. </li>
<li>A Jenmi differs from such landlords in that he does not derive his title to lands from the Sirdar etc. His title to the Jenmom lands is inherent. He is, so far as his Jenmom lands are concerned, a little territorial sovereign in a limited sense. He is landlord of his Jenmom domain exactly in the sense in which this Sirkar is landlord of all the land it <strong><u>grants to planters</u></strong> and indeed to all ryots in general; in the sense in which the British government is landlord of all the Ryotwari lands of the East Coast Zillahs of the Madras Presidency.</li>
<li>It is necessary, in view to avoid errors and misconceptions, to familiarize the mind to this definition of t Jenmi. The origin of Jenmom property may be briefly explained here with a view to make the rights of jenmis clear. Kerala Desom   (in which Travancore is included) was originally conquered by Parasurama, and this great warrior parcelled out the conquered lands among a limited number of brahmins. The Brahmins then became territorial lords, each independent of the rest. From that early age, the lands have descended with the tenure almost unimpared. The lands so belonging to each Brahmin are said to constitute his Jenmom, and the Brahmin himself is called a jenmi. These lands, so long as they continue in possession of the Jenmi, are free of all taxation. To this day this exemption continues in full force.</li>
<li>Jenmom lands are precisely what are in Europe called allodial properties as contradistinguished from feudal. It must be clear from what has been stated that all the lands in Travancore belong to a body of jenmis. There are no lands that do not belong to some Jenmi or other. Be it remembered that the Sirkar itself is one of these Jenmis, it  having come to possess Jenmom lands by gift, purchase, eacheat, confiscation and other ways. It is only a great Jenmi, great in the sense that its jenmom property is extensive. If any person wants land in Travancore, he must obtain it from, and hold it of, some one of the body of Jenmis, i. e. , from the Sirhar, which is the chief Jenmi, or from some other Jenmi”. (pp. 2 and 3 of <strong>Travancore land Revenue Manual, Vol. IV</strong>)</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Note: Padmanabharu Govindaru  v. The State of Kerala, AIR 1963 Ker 86 gives us “illuminative information as to the concept of ‘jenmom’” as pointed out in Harrisons Malayalam Limited v. State of Kerala, 2018 2 KerHC 719; 2018 2 KerLT 369 – though this decision was overruled by the larger Bench in Rev. Fr. Victor Fernandez Vs. Albert Fernandez, AIR 1971 Ker 168</em> :<em>1971 KerLT 1).</em></p>
<p>6. <strong><u>Majeed v. State of Kerala</u></strong> <strong><u>Grant and the Right of Ownership</u></strong></p>
<p>In  Majeed v. State of Kerala,(2006) 1 KerLT 19, the <strong>State demanded seigniorage</strong> under  Kerala Grants and Leases Modification of Rights Act, 1980. Petitioner was a person who purchased trees from Travancore Rubber and Tea Company Ltd. Disputes and questions arose in the light of of the Kerala Grants &amp; Leases (Modification of Rights) Act, 1980. Admittedly there was originally a <strong>grant</strong>. The scope of ‘grant’ was disputed. The <strong>contention of the petitioner</strong> was that it was the <strong>free hold property.</strong> The court did not accept the argument.</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>The rejected contention was stated by the Court as under:</li>
<li>“The <strong>petitioner contends</strong> that the respondents have <strong>no authority to demand seigniorage</strong> in respect of the timber of the trees planted by the company, as the property in question granted in favour of the company is <strong>not a leasehold property</strong>, but a <strong><u>free hold property</u></strong>, as is revealed by the order of grant Exts. R2(i).”</li>

In<strong> Harska Turst v. State</strong> <strong>of Kerala</strong>, ILR  1960 Ker 345, 1960 Ker LT 378, it is observed as under:</p>

<li>“ The Edavagais were petty kingdoms or principalities which remained independent or quasi independent until the consolidation of Travancore in the 18<sup>th</sup> century. </li>

<p><strong><u>Edavagai Rights Acquisition Act, 1955</u></strong></p>
<p>‘The Edavagai Act intended acquisition and extinguishing of all Edavagai rights over the Edavagais of Edapally, Kilimanoor, Poonjar and Vanjipuzha’ as observed in <strong>Harrisons Malayalam Limited v. State of Kerala</strong>, 2018-2 KLT 369. The Edavagai rights were that vested in the –</p>

<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">History of Land Tax Collection from Edavagai Lands</span></strong></p>
<p>Harska Trust v. State of Kerala, ILR  1960 Ker 345, 1960 Ker LT 378, clearly lays down the history. It is pointed out that the collection of Basic-Tax was first introduced by the Travancore Land Tax Proclamation, 1121. Sec. 6 of the Proclamation provided that the Proclamation would not be applicable to certain classes of lands. One of those classes was-</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“Freeholds (Adhikara Ozhivus) belonging to the Edavagais of Edapally, Kilimanoor, Vanjipuzha and Poonjar”. </li>
</ul>
<p>The reason for non-collection of Tax from Edavagais was also laid down in this decision as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“Edavagais were petty kingdoms or principalities which remained independent or quasi-independent until the consolidation of Travancore in the 18th century. They were outside the State Ayacut and paid no land tax. The Chiefs, however, in exercise of their ancient sovereign powers, collected Melvaram or Melvara Rajabhogam from the jenmis inside the Edavagais (See 1945 TLR 581 and 728).”</li>
</ul>
<p>As pointed out in Harska Trust v. State of Kerala, ILR  1960 Ker 345, the next enactment was the Travancore-Cochin Land Tax Act, 1955 which came into force on 1-4-1956. Sec. 17 of the Land Tax Act, 1955, repealed the Travancore Land Tax Proclamation, 1121. </p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline">The Act provided no exemption from tax to lands situated within the Edavagais</span>. The reason thereof was the already promulgated <span style="text-decoration: underline">Edavagai Rights Acquisition Act, 1955</span>. It is laid down in Harska Trust v. State of Kerala, ILR  1960 Ker 345, as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li> “8. The <span style="text-decoration: underline">rights of the Poonjar Chief were acquired by the State under the </span><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">Edavagai Rights Acquisition Act, 1955</span>,</strong> which came into force on 1-1-1956. Edavagai rights is defined in <strong>Sec. 2(5) of that Act</strong> as follows:</li>
<li>Edavagai rights means all the rights and privileges vested in
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>the Edapally Swaroopam,</li>
<li>the Kilimanoor Kottaram,</li>
<li>the Poonjar Koickal and</li>
<li>the Vanjipuzha Matom</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li> relating to heir respective Edavagais and includes in the case of the Poonjar Koickal the right to receive Melvaram in respect of lands situate within the Edavagai of Poonjar.</li>
<li>9. <strong>Sub-s.(1) of S.3 </strong>of the Act provided that on and from its commencement, the privileges of the Edapally Swaroopam and the Poonjar Koickal relating to Excise Revenues of the Edavagais of Edapally and Poonjar shall stand extinguished, and <strong>sub-s.(2)</strong>:
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“All the Edavagai rights of the Edapally Swaroopam and the Poonjar Koickal other than those mentioned in sub-section [1] and all the Edavagai rights of the Kilimanoor Kottaram and the Vanjipuzha Matom over their respective Edavagais, and <span style="text-decoration: underline">all rights, title and interests <strong>vested in the Chiefs</strong>, in respect of waste lands or thanathu lands which have been <strong>assigned by </strong>them on <strong>Kuthagapattom</strong></span> or other like demises, </li>

</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Sub-sec. (2) of Sec. 4</strong> <span style="text-decoration: underline">fixed the compensation payable</span> by the Government to the Edavagais for the acquisition of the rights, title, and interests mentioned in sub-s.(2) of S.3 at the amounts as specified in the Schedule, being 8 1/3 times the annual income of the respective Edavagais less five per cent for collection charges. It is clear from these provisions that what was acquired was the Chiefs rights, and it is difficult to understand how the acquisition of those rights can possibly affect the right of the State to tax the lands concerned.</li>
<li>10. The right to basic tax is in no sense a manifestation of the Chiefs right to Melvaram. It is a right founded on the Constitution and not on the acquisition of the rights of the Edavagais.”</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><u>Edavagai Rights Acquisition Act, <span style="text-decoration: underline">did Not change Character of Holdings</span></u></strong></p>
<p>The object behind the act is very clear – it was only to ‘acquire’ the rights of the Edavagais; it was not to change the character of the land held by the tenants or purchasers.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline">Lease-holdings of the Edavagais continued as Lease holdings, but with liability to pay Tax.</span></p>
<p>In <strong>Harrisons Malayalam Limited v. State of Kerala</strong>, 2018-2 KLT 369, it is pointed out-The Edavagai Rights Acquisition Act, 1955 <span style="text-decoration: underline">did not change the character of the holdings</span> and it only interfered with the right, title and interest of the respective Edavagais; <span style="text-decoration: underline">they made made to vest with the Government</span>. The effect was that the <span style="text-decoration: underline">liability of the tenants  to pay rent</span> or other levies to the Edavagais stoo<span style="text-decoration: underline">d altered as liability to tax</span> imposed by the Government.</p>
<p>The 1955 Act is analysed in Harrisons Malayalam Limited v. State of Kerala, as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“There was also a saving clause in Section 11 which exempted from vesting, those lands held by the Chiefs as a Jenmy or as a pattadar under the Government and those held by the families, already settled and assessed, as also those lands in the direct possession of the Chiefs and any of the members of the respective families.”</li>
</ul>
<p>Then it is observed by the High Court of Kerala as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“Hence <span style="text-decoration: underline">land existing on a <strong>lease</strong></span> from either of the Edavagais <span style="text-decoration: underline">or as <strong>f</strong></span><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">reehold</span></strong> <span style="text-decoration: underline">on valid purchase</span> made, continues in the possession and ownership of the land holder/lessee and the <span style="text-decoration: underline">liability to payment of rent</span> or other levies to the Edavagais would <span style="text-decoration: underline">stand altered as liability to tax</span> imposed by the Government.

<li>It was pointed out-<ul><li>“The <span style="text-decoration: underline">‘Edavagai Rights’ is defined</span> under sub-section (5), as the <span style="text-decoration: underline">rights and privileges which vested in the families and ‘Chief</span>’ was defined under sub-section (6) as the senior male member of the respective families, in whom the management of the family is vested.”</li></ul>
<ul class="wp-block-list">

</ul>
</li>
<li>Note: Here the High Court of Kerala (in Harrisons Malayalam Limited v. State of Kerala, 2018-2 KLT 369) did not consider the effect of grant. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">Did Edavagai Rights Acquisition Act, 1955 confer Title to ‘Registered Holders</span></strong>‘</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Sec. 8(1) of the Edavagai Rights Acquisition Act, 1955 reads as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“On and from the first day of April 1956, every <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">registered holding</span></strong> in an Edavagai shall be <strong>deemed</strong> to be a holding registered under Government, and <span style="text-decoration: underline">every registered land holder thereof shall be <strong>deemed</strong> to be a registered holder and pattadar under Governmen</span>t, and the holding shall be <span style="text-decoration: underline">liable to basic tax</span> imposed by Government, from time to time, <span style="text-decoration: underline">in lieu of the <strong>rent </strong></span>assessed thereon at the settlement of the Edavagai. </li>
</ul>
<p>If we take the words, in Sec. 8(1) – that, “<span style="text-decoration: underline">in lieu of the <strong>rent </strong></span>assessed thereon at the settlement of the Edavagai” – as that used by the legislature purposefully, we have to say that <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">no title is conferred</span></strong> inasmuch as the lease (associated with rent) is not given-a-go-bye. From Harska Trust v. State of Kerala, ILR  1960 Ker 345 (<mark class="has-inline-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#910729">note the words – “</mark><span style="text-decoration: underline"><mark class="has-inline-color has-primary-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">But for Sec. 8(1) of the Edavagai Rights Acquisition Act, 1955, both the basic tax and the Melvaram </mark><mark class="has-inline-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#cf2e2e">would have been payable</mark></span>“), it appears that this is the view that is taken in this decision. It reads as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“17. It is settled law that <span style="text-decoration: underline">if a right has been acquired by virtue of a statute</span>, it is <span style="text-decoration: underline">not necessarily taken away by the repeal</span> of that statute (See: AIR 1950 Pat 505). What the argument fails to note is the fact that it is not the repeal of the Travancore Edavagai Act, 1109, which attracts the basic tax to these lands but the positive provisions embodied in the Land Tax Act, 1955. <span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>But for</strong> Sec. 8(1) of the Edavagai Rights Acquisition Act, 1955, <strong><mark class="has-inline-color has-primary-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">both the basic tax and the Melvaram </mark><mark class="has-inline-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#cf2e2e">would have been payable</mark></strong>.</span> That sub-section restricts the claim <span style="text-decoration: underline">to basic tax</span>.” </li>
<li>18. We are unable to hold that the impugned imposition of the basic tax is in any way ultra vires of the powers of the State under the Constitution or violative of any legal right vested in the petitioners before us. It must follow that these petitions have to be dismissed and we do so with costs, advocates fee Rs. 100 in each of the two petitions.</li>
</ul>
<p>It can also be seen that the purport of the act is not conferring tile to the ‘registered holdings’. </p>

<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">‘Holder of property’ – ‘Pattadaran’</span></strong></p>
<p>In Kerala, in the Land Tax Act Rules, 1972 and the Tax Receipt, describes the ‘holder of property’ as ‘Pattadaran’. It is definite that he is not the title holder.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Transfer of Registry Rules (Kerala) makes it clear</strong> </span>– Patta and Title Different Concepts. In Moideen v. Village Officer, 9 January, 2019(Alexander Thomas, J.) Kerala High Court pointed out with reference to Rule 16 of the Transfer of Registry Rules that the mutation or acceptance of basic land tax, by itself, <strong><u>will not confer or extinguish title</u></strong> and that in accordance with the decisions of the Civil Court <strong><u>pattas will be revised from time to time</u></strong>. It is observed further as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“Rule 16 of the Transfer Registry Rules envisages that summary enquiry and decision thereon envisaged under those rule is only an arrangement for fiscal purposes and does not affect the legal rights of any person in respect of the lands covered by the decisions in transfer of registry cases and the prescribed legal rights is always subject to adjudication by Civil Court and <strong>pattas will be revised from time to time</strong> in accordance with such judicial decisions.”</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><u>In Cochin also – “Patta” denoted Lease</u><span style="text-decoration: underline"> </span></strong></p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>‘Patta’ was used in Travancore &amp; Cochin to denote Government-recognition of both lease lands and Janmam lands.</li>
</ul>
<p>In Harska Trust v. State of Kerala, ILR  1960 Ker 345, it is pointed out as under –</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>‘According to the petitioners, the issue of the <span style="text-decoration: underline">Patta</span> under that Act in respect of these lands was something duly done and the repeal of the Act cannot in any way affect the right granted under that Patta, namely, the right to continue in possession of the lands till the end of 1144 o<span style="text-decoration: underline">n payment of Rs. 2,665 (about) per year as rent</span> against the basic tax now demanded of over Rs. 12,000 per year’.</li>

<p><strong><u>Purambokes</u></strong></p>
<p>Purambokes were unassessed Govt. lands connected with public works or used or reserved for public purposes, such as public road, and margins within their defined boundaries, public lanes and pathways, heads and banks of Rivers, Irrigation and drainage channels, Lakes and Backwaters, Markets, Burial-grounds, and Landing Bhats.</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Lands acquired for public purposes were also included under the head ‘Purambokle’ in Revenue Registers.</li>
<li>The functions of the Land Revenue Department were to prevent encroachment.</li>
<li>Where an unobjectionable encroachment, the head of the land was changed to ‘<em>Tharisu</em>’.</li>
<li>Objectionable encroachment was punished with fine and charged to prohibitory assessment till retracted.</li>
<li>Land Revenue Department granted leases of poramboke for putting up shops in Markets and given permission to occupy the land in Festivals.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><u>Tharisu or Assessed Waste</u></strong></p>
<p>Tharisu was the waste lands ‘at the disposal of the Govt’ and available for ‘extension of cultivation’. It was distinguished from poramboke. Unauthorized occupation of <em>tharisu</em> was also punishable. </p>

<li>Under the Puthuel Rules (1097 ME : 1922) it had to be done by public auction or by ‘assignment otherwise than by auction’. Such converted lands were treated as ‘pandarappattom’ lands.</li>
<li>In the Puthuval Rules there was provision for ‘Concessional Registry of Lands’. for the assignment to the members of the depressed classes or to indigent families belonging to other communities, on application made to the Tahsildar of the Taluk. </li>

<p><strong><span style="text-decoration:underline">Revenue Records – Maintained Promptly</span></strong></p>
<p>The Land Revenue Department was one of the main departments of the Travancore Government.  The ownership remained with the Jenmies and Sircar (Government). The agriculturists, who formed majority of population,  had to pay various kinds of remunerations to the <em>Janmies</em> and the Sircar (Government),  based on the nature of tenancy and the nature of the ‘Jenmam right’. The lease arrangements were known by various nomenclatures based on the conditions of tenancies. Several enactments were made for proper collection of Taxes, and management of the Govt. lands and the lands upon which the tenants toiled. The Revenue Records were prepared and maintained promptly.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration:underline">Various <u>L</u></span><u>and-Tenuers</u></strong></p>
<p>The tenures, according to the Travancore Land Revenue Manual, Volume III (1915), fall under two main heads:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>(1) Sirkar or Pandaravaga; </li>
<li>(2) Janmam.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><u>760 Types of Tenures in Travancore</u></strong><strong><u></u></strong></p>
<p>In ‘Historical Introduction to the Kerala Land Reforms Act and the Working of the Land Tribunals’ PN Prabhakaran Pillai, says as under: </p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“The land tenures that existed in the former Travancore area were very complex and special tenures and sub-tenures were numerous It may be seen that there were 760 types of tenures including sub-tenures in Travancore area alone. At the last Revenue Settlement’, an endeavour was made to systematise and simplify the tenures as far as possible. After the settlement, the number of tenures were reduced to a considerable minimum. The numerous tenures which have been recognised at the settlement may be generally traced to one or other of main two heads, viz., Sirkar or Pandaravaka and Jenmom.”</li>
</ul>
<p>In settlement (1910), numerous tenures had been recognized.  For practical purposes, as per the Travancore Land Revenue Manual, the tenures were classified as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>1. Sirkar or Pandaravaga </li>
<li>2. Sirkar Devaswom vaga</li>

</ul>
<p><span style="text-decoration:underline"><strong>1. Sirkar or Pandaravaga:</strong></span></p>
<p>This tenure represents Sirkar as the landlord.  The tenures fall under the following heads: </p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>a)  Pandarapattom,</li>
</ul>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Pandarapattom was <span style="text-decoration:underline">originally in the nature of lease without any proprietary or transferable right.</span>  By the <span style="text-decoration:underline">royal proclamations</span>, the holders of these lands were given with <span style="text-decoration:underline">full proprietary rights</span> and declared to be private, heritable and transferrable property.  Puthuval lands came under this tenure.  </li>
<li>b)  Otti</li>
</ul>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>It was originally in the nature of a mortgage.  It stood as a real or constructive loan by the State.  Interest was deducted from <em>Pattom</em> to be paid by the holder.  He had also to pay Rajabhogam (tax).</li>

</ul>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Enams were service enams or personal enams.  Service enams were inalienable.  It continue as long as the holder was in service.  Personal enams were given to support individuals or families.  Such properties could have been transferred by the holders.</li>

<li>The lands under this head were originally <em>janmam</em> lands or private property of Devaswoms.  They were held on <em>venpattom</em> tenure.  Later on, Sirkar took over the Devaswoms and the lands were treated as Sirkar lands.  Subsequently, <em>Sirkar Devaswom</em> lands were separated from Sirkar lands; and separate accounts were kept.</li>

</ul>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration:underline">5. Sree Pandaravaga</span></strong></p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Sree  Pandaravaka land was the land owned by the Sree Padmanabhaswamy Temple and registered in the revenue records as ‘Sree Pandaravaka’ (See: The Sree Pandaravaka Lands (Vesting And Enfranchisement) Act, 1971).</li>
<li>Sree Padmanabha Swamy Temple had originally been administered by Madathil Pillamars. The lands that belonged to the Temple were in the possession of various persons under different tenures. All such persons were liable to pay tax as ‘Rajabhogam’. The grants or Inams were made by the Kingdom for the services rendered. Such Inams included tenures like Adima, Anubhogam, Thiruvulam, Thiruvadayalam etc. The Madathil Pillamars collected the Michavaram due to Devaswom on those lands to be utilized for the poojas and other rituals to be performed in the temple.</li>
<li>When the Revenue Settlement was prepared (in 1910), all the properties that were classified under the names of the different Madoms were brought under the class ‘Sree Pandaravaka’. The lands that were in the names of the family members, received as personal Inams were described as Kudumbaporuthy lands.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration:underline">6. Janmam</span></strong></p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>It was the properties owned by <em>Janmies</em>.  Regulation of 1071 (1896) attracted these properties.  The tax under Rajabhogam had to be paid for this land.   But Devaswom and Brahmaswom thanathu lands, though came under the head ‘Janmam’, were exempted from tax, so long as they remained unalienated.  When alienated it was charged under Rajabhogam assessment.  Devaswom and Brehmaswom properties could have been subjected to outright sale.</li>

<p>The chief land systems of tenancy under which tenants held lands owned by others were called Verumpattom. This was simple leasehold. By a series of legislative enactments, culminated in the Cochin Tenancy Act (1118 ME – 1943) – hailed as the ‘great charter’ for the tenants, tenants gained occupancy rights in the lands held by them.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration:underline">Kanam</span></strong></p>
<p>Verumpattom became a kanam when the landlord acknowledged liability to pay a lump sum to the tenant on the redemption of his lease.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration:underline">Pankuvaramdars</span></strong></p>
<p>Under this tenancy tenants raised crops on agricultural lands in partnership with the owners, the terms of partnership varyied from place to place.</p>

The Proclamation aimed to make better the status of the men toiled in the agricultural fields and to improve the economic insecurity of the tenants, and thereby increase the revenue of the King also. </p>
<p>Purushothaman Nambudiri v. State of Kerala, AIR 1962 SC 694, describes the 1905 declaration as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“This proclamation consists of twenty- eight clauses which deal broadly with all the aspects of land tenure prevailing in the State of Cochin. The preamble to the proclamation recites that the Raja had already ordered that a complete survey embracing demarcation and mapping and the preparation of an accurate record of titles in respect of all descriptions of properties within his entire State shall be carried out, and it adds that directions had been issued that a revenue settlement or revision of the State demand shall be conducted in accordance with the principles laid down by the proclamation. Clause 6 enumerates the tenures of lands prevailing in the State. Under this clause there are two major tenures –
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>(1) Pandaravaka and </li>
<li>(2) Puravaka. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The former are held on one or the other of six varieties of tenures; of these we are concerned with the verumpattom sub-tenure. This clause provides that the Pandaravaka verumpattom tenure shall be deemed as the normal tenure for settling the full State demand and that the other tenures shall be treated as favourable tenures and settled on the lines indicated in cls. 14 to 17. Clause 7 says that the present rate of assessment on Pandaravaka verumpattom nilas varies from one eighth para to twelve paras of paddy for every para of land; and it adds that such a vast disparity of rates is indicative of unequal incidence under the existing revenue system. That is why the clause proceeds to lay down that the State demand should bear a fixed proportion to the produce a land is capable of yielding and so it prescribes that under the Pandaravaka verumpattom tenure the holder should pay half of the net produce to the State. The clause then proceeds to provide for the method in which this half of the net produce should be determined. Clauses 11 and 12 deal with the assessment on tree.</li>
<li>Clause 13 is important. It says: 
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“at present holders of <span style="text-decoration: underline">Pandaravaka verumpattom lands do not possess any property in the soil</span>. As <span style="text-decoration: underline">we are convinced that proprietorship in the soil will induce the cultivator to improve his land</span> and thereby add to the prosperity of the land, we hereby <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline"><mark class="has-inline-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#1400db">declare that the verumpattom holders of lands shall,</mark></span><mark class="has-inline-color has-primary-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"> </mark></strong>after the new settlement has been introduced, <span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong><mark class="has-inline-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#1400db">acquire full rights to the soil of the lands they hold</mark></strong></span> and that their rights shall remain undisturbed so long as they regularly pay the State revenue provided that the rights to metals, minerals possessed by the State in all lands under whatever tenure they are held are reserved to the State”.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Under cl. 18 it is provided, inter alia, that in the case of Pandaravaka lands held on the verumpattom tenure the settlement shall be made with the present holder of the land and in regard to Puravaka land with the Janmam. Clause 22 prescribes the procedure and the time for the introduction of settlement. It requires that before the introduction of the new rates of assessment a rough patta shall be issued to each of the landholders showing the relevant detail of his holdings and the assessment to be paid by him hereafter. The object of preparing such a patta is to give an opportunity to the landholders to bring to the notice of the authorities their objections if any. The objections are then required to be heard before the final entries are made. Clause 26 declares that the new settlement shall be current for a term of thirty years. This has been done with a view to secure the utmost freedom of action to the landholders in improving their properties and turning them to the best advantage according to their means and inclination. Clause 27 deals with escheats; and cl. 28 makes general provisions as to the formation of a new land record including reassessment of land and the registration of titles “a work calculated to promote the well- being of a State”.</li>

<li>Sir Thomas Munro, Madras Governor, introduced ryotwari system throughout the Madras Presidency in 1820.  </li>
<li>Under the ryotwari system, land was given on lease by the government to the ryot under a patta.</li>
<li>A ryotwari pattadar was not a proprietor of land in its full sense, but only a tenant.</li>
<li>British Government collected taxes directly from the peasants. The rate of tax was 50% in dry-lands and 60% in irrigated land.</li>
<li>In S. Thenappa Chettiarv. State of Tamil Nadu, AIR 1986 SC 1117, it was held, following Khajamian Wakf Estates v. State of Madras, AIR 1971 SC 161, that the expression ‘estate’ in Article 31A included ‘ryotwari’ land also by virtue of the Seventeenth Amendment of the Constitution on June 20, 1964 with retrospective effect.</li>

<p>As stated above, <span style="font-size:revert;background-color:var(--global--color-background);color:var(--global--color-foreground);font-family:var(--global--font-secondary)">Sir Thomas Munro, Madras Governor, introduced ryotwari system throughout the Madras Presidency in 1820.  </span>The basic idea of ryotwari settlement (revenue-settlement is fixing tax or rent, after survey in most cases) was that every bit of land was assessed to a certain revenue and assigned a survey number for a period of years, which was usually thirty and each occupant of such land held it subject to his paying the land-revenue fixed on that land. But it was open to the occupant to relinquish his land or to take new land which had been relinquished by some other occupant or become otherwise available on payment of assessment (Land Systems of British India by Baden-Powell.  See: Thressiamma Jacob v.  Geologist, Dptt. of Mining, 2013-9  SCC 725).</p>

<p>In Purushothaman Nambudiri v. State of Kerala, AIR 1962 SC 694, the legislatice History of Kerala Agrarian Relations Bill is given. It reads as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“The Kerala Agrarian Relations Bill which has ultimately become the Act was published in the Government Gazette of Kerala on December 18, 1957 and was introduced in the Kerala Legislative Assembly on December 21, 1957 by the Communist Government which was then in power.</li>
<li>The bill was discussed in the Assembly and was ultimately passed by it on June 10, 1959. It was then reserved by the Governor of the state for the assent of the President under Art. 200 of the Constitution, Meanwhile, on July 31, 1959 the President issued a proclamation under Art. 356 and the Assembly was dissolved. In February1960 mid-term general elections took place in Kerala and as a result a coalition Government came into power.</li>
<li>On July 27, 1960 the President for whose assent the bill was pending sent it back with his message requesting the Legislative Assembly to reconsider the bill in the light of the specific amendments suggested by him. On August 2, 1960 the Governor returned the bill remitted by the President with his message and the amendments suggested by him to the new Assembly for consideration. On September 26, 1960 the amendments suggested by the President were taken up for consideration by the Assembly and ultimately on October 15, 1960 the bill as amended in the light of the President s recommendations was passed by the Assembly. It then received the assent of the President on January 21, 1961, and after it thus became law.”</li>
</ul>
<p>The Supreme Court struck down the 1961 Act as regards its application to the ryotwari lands of Hosdurg and Kasargod Taluks, as unconstitutional, on the ground that it was violative of the Art. 14 of the Constitution, in Kunjikoman V. State of Kerala, AIR 1962 SC 723 .</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration:underline"><strong>Royal Pattom Proclamation of 1040</strong></span> <span style="text-decoration:underline"><strong>(1865 AD) – Fist Gigantic Step</strong></span></p>
<p>During the second half of the 19<sup>th</sup> century several Royal Proclamations were promulgated with a view to confer rights in the land to the tenants who were the real cultivators. Majority of the people were engaged in agriculture; but the lands belonged to Jenmies (Sircar, Brahmins or Devaswoms). The cultivators held the land under lease arrangement known as Pattom, Otti, Inam and Viruthi etc. One of the important Regulations came in the line of agrarian reforms was the Royal Proclamation of 1040 ME (1865 AD). It pertained to Pattom (lease) tenements created (by Sircar) on Sirkar lands known as Pandaravaka lands. It is exalted as the Magna Carta of peasants of Travancore it being led to conferring land to tillers, step by  step.</p>
<p><strong><u>Proclamation of 1040 (1865)</u></strong> <strong><u>– </u><span style="text-decoration: underline">No Proprietary Rights</span><u>; But, Permanency to Cultivators</u></strong></p>
<p>Till 1040 ME (1865 AD), the agriculturists, who held the Pandaravaka lands under <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">Pattom </span></strong>arrangement, were liable to be treated as mere tenants-at-will; the land being resumable resumable (by the Government) at any time, as they were in the nature of temporary leases just like tenements created by private jenmis.</p>
<p>The Pattom Proclamation of 1040 (1865) converted the pattom arrangement on pandaravaka lands into <span style="text-decoration:underline">permanent <strong>leases</strong></span> <span style="text-decoration:underline">and </span>conferred on the holders thereof <span style="text-decoration:underline">permanent rights of occupancy</span>, heritable and alienable. Though the Proclamation of 1040 ME did not  expressly confer full proprietary rights on tenants, it gave the tenants permanency in the Pandaravaka soil; and it recorded the fist gigantic step towards the land reforms in Travancore.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration:underline">Royal Proclamation of 1061 (1886) Brings in Further Radical Changes</span></strong></p>
<p>Paragraph 9 of the Proclamation of 1061 says, with reference to <u>Royal Proclamation of the 21st Edavam 1040</u>, as regards Pandarapattam lands, as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“these lands were originally the absolute property of Government, and the tenants were mere tenants-at-will; but, <strong><u>by the Royal Proclamation of the 21st Edavam 1040</u></strong>, Government generously waived all right to these lands, and declared them to be the private, hereitable, saleable property of the holders.”</li>
</ul>
<p>Section 22 of the Settlement Proclamation of 1061 (1886) made radical changes in land tenure. </p>
<p>Those changes were:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>(1)   <span style="text-decoration:underline">no debt shall be recognised as due</span> to the holder;</li>
<li>(2) <span style="text-decoration:underline">no interest shall be deducted from the <strong>Pattom</strong></span> on such debt;   </li>
<li>(3) <span style="text-decoration:underline">no reduction of debt or a corresponding enhancement</span> of the Sirkar demand shall be made when such properties were transferred by sale.</li>
<li>The properties held on the tenures in question shall be <span style="text-decoration:underline">recognised as so many favourably assessed lands</span> or Inams and confirmed to the holders as such. </li>
</ul>
<p>Clause 7 of Section 24 of the Proclamation provided as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“There shall be <span style="text-decoration:underline">no further interference on the part of the Government with these <strong>free holds</strong></span>, except such as might be necessary for the punctual realization of the quit <strong>rent</strong> payable”.(Quoted in: Padmanabharu Govindaru  v. The State of Kerala, AIR 1963 Ker 86.)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><u>Jenmi &amp; Kudiyan Act (1896)</u></strong><span style="text-decoration:underline"><strong> and  Amendments – Made Kudiyan, Full Owner</strong></span></p>
<p>‘Jenmam land’ is defined in the Jenmi and Kudiyan Regulation, V of 1071 (1896), as land (other than Pandaravaka, Sripandaravaka, Kandukrishi or Sircar Devaswom land, recognised as such in the Sircar accounts) which is either entirely exempt from Government tax or if assessed to public revenue, is subject to Rajabhogam only, and the occupancy right in which is created for a  money consideration (Kanom) and is also subject to the payment of Michavaram or customary dues and the payment of the renewal fees.</p>
<p>This definition is intended for the purposes of the Regulation, which regulates the relations between Janmis and their Kanapattom tenants. A Janmi has not only Kanapattom tenants but has other tenants as well holding on Adima Anubhogam, Thiruvulam and similar other tenures and the Regulation is not concerned with the latter class of tenants in whose case the ordinary law of landlord and tenant is applicable. Revenue law, on the other hand, makes no distinction between a Kanapattom tenant and a non Kanapattom tenant if he holds under a Janmi recognised in the revenue accounts. </p>
<p>Before Travancore Jenmi and Kudiyan Act, V of 1071 (1896), <span style="text-decoration:underline">lands were granted</span> as Inams by the Sovereign <span style="text-decoration:underline">to Devaswoms and Brahmin jenmies</span>.  (Sreekumaran Kesavan Namboori v. Gopalan Madhavan, 1956 KLT 256). </p>
<p>The Jenmi &amp; Kudiyan Regulation of 1071 ME (1896) was passed <span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>to stop the injustices perpetrated on the Kudiyans</strong> (bond-servants)</span>. It was amended by the Amendment Regulation of 1108 ME.  The report of the Committee which led to the Amendment Regulation of 1108 ME reads as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“6. The outstanding feature of the amendment is that i<span style="text-decoration:underline">t lays the ghost of the Jenmis’ ownership for ever</span>. The Jenmi has been expropriated and reduced to the position of a mere rentier. Refined considerations in the interests of the reciprocal rights and obligations have all been swept away. The solution of the problem looks like the cutting of the Gordian knot and the process is rather rough and coarse by the side of the Regulation of 1071. The measure is eminently democratic. T<span style="text-decoration:underline">o some extent it is socialistic also.</span> For, one of the aims of some schools of social reformers, is to <span style="text-decoration:underline">make the labourer free by breaking down the relationship of master and servant </span>and similar situations involving superiority and inferiority by means of legislative interference. Whatever it be, to all appearance the jenmi has received the knock-out-blow. Yet it may be asked whether he has not good reason to come back smiling. For what he is entitled to by way of michavaram, renewal fees and customary dues has been consolidated and spread out with the advantage that he is assured of the payment without any worry. The burden on the Kudiyan is clearly fixed and the door has been closed on the chance of his escape. It remains to be seen who is the better for the present amendment of the Regulation”.<em> (Quoted in: Harrisons Malayalam Limited v. State of Kerala, 2018-2 KHC 719; 2018-2 KLT 369)</em></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline">The </span><span style="text-decoration:underline">changes introduced by the Amended Regulation </span>reads as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“i. <span style="text-decoration:underline"><strong>Jenmi is not the owner of the land hereafter</strong></span>, his right being confined to the receipt of Jenmikaram as fixed by the law;</li>

<li>iii. Jenmikaram is to be regulated and controlled by the Settlement Pattamicham and not by the Kanappattam contract except till the next general Land Revenue Settlement and, that even, only subject to certain statutory limitations;</li>
<li>iv. no renewals are hereafter obligatory;</li>
<li>v. Jenmis’ dues may be fractioned out and paid annually and in money as prescribed by the Statute;</li>
<li>vi. the rate of interest on arrears of Jenmikaram has been reduced to nine per cent whether payable in kind or in money when collected by the Jenmy direct, or under the provisions of chapter III or otherwise through Court, and to six per cent when collected by the Government under the provisions of chapter IV;</li>
<li>vii. The period of limitation for recovery of arrears of Jenmikaram has been reduced from the former period of twelve years to a period of six years;</li>
<li>viii. Government have undertaken the collection of Jenmikaram and payment thereof over to the Jenmi;</li>
<li>ix. in the case of Government realising the Jenmikaram under the provisions of chapter IV only the land on which the Jenmikaram is a charge shall be sold for arrears of jenmikaram, though this restriction may not apply as regards the movables of the defaulter;</li>

</ul>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration:underline">Cochin Settlement Proclamation of 1080 (1905) </span></strong></p>
<p>As shown above, the Sirkar or Pandaravaka tenure holders of the Kingdom of Cochin were conferred with fixity of tenure by the Settlement Proclamation of 1080 (1905). </p>
<p>The Settlement Proclamation of 1905 covered all lands in the State, including lands held under concessional tenures or as tax-free. The Rules made under the Act contained the procedure for the issue of title deeds in respect of lands held under such grants. As stated above, Clause 13 of the Settlement Proclamation provided that the holders of <span style="text-decoration:underline">Pandaravaka <strong>Verumpattom</strong> lands </span>would <span style="text-decoration:underline">acquire ‘full rights to the soil of the lands</span>‘ they held. Settlement Proclamation of Cochin of 1080 (1905) Clause 13 provided as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“At present holders of Pandaravaka <strong>Verumpattom</strong> lands do not possess any property in the soil. As we are convinced that proprietorship in soil will induce a cultivator to improve his land and thereby add to agricultural prosperity of the country, we hereby declare that our <strong>Verumpattom</strong> holders of lands shall, <span style="text-decoration:underline">after the new settlement has been introduced, <strong>acquire full rights to the soil of the lands they hold</strong></span> and that their rights shall remain undisturbed so long as they regularly pay the State revenue, provided that the rights to metals and minerals, possessed by the State in all lands under whatever tenures they are held, are reserved to the State”.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Settlement Proclamation of 1905 was expressly repealed by the Land Tax Act of 1955 of the united State of Travancore-Cochin; but this Act, as a whole, was struck down by the Supreme Court in AIR 1961 SC 552. In <strong>Kesavan Vadhyan Namboodri v. State of Kerala, AIR 1968 Ker 279</strong>, it was pointed out that this Proclamation of 1080 (1905) stood repealed by implication by the Land Tax Act of 1961.</p>
<p>Section 4 of the Cochin Verumpattomdars Act, 1118, reads as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“Notwithstanding any law, custom or contract to the contrary, every verumpattomdar shall have fixity of tenure in respect of his holding and shall not be evicted therefrom except as provided in Section 8 of this act.”</li>
</ul>
<p>Section 4 concerned with the fixity of tenure, that is, fixity of the period of holding, possession or enjoyment of the land. The effect of such a mere conferment of fixity of tenure was not to continue the lease beyond the period specified therein, but to give to the person who continues to remain in possession of the land after the lease has come to an end the status of a statutory tenant. (Ittiravi Namboodiri Vs. Krishnankutty Menon AIR 1964 Ker 298. Dr. K. A. Dhairyawan V. J. R. Thakur, AIR 1958 SC 789, referred to.)</p>
<p><strong><u>Travancore Jenmi and Kudiyan (Amendment) Act, 1935</u></strong></p>
<p>‘Proceedings of the Travancore Sri Chitra State Council’ recorded the speech of Kayalam Paramesvaran Pillai (Additional Head Sircar Vakil) while moving the Travancore Jenmi and Kudiyan Regulation (Amendment) Bill, on 28<sup>th</sup> May 1935, as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“Sir, I beg to move that the Travancore Jenmi Kudiyan Regulation (Amendment) Bill, as passed by the Sri Mulam Assembly, be taken into consideration. I am sure that honourable members have carefully gone through the Bill and that it is not necessary for me to explain the principles underlying the Bill at great length. It will be noticed that the main point for which this Bill is proposed is in regard to jenmikaram in respect of cherikal lands held on Kanapattom. Honourable members know what a kanapattom transaction is. It is a demise by a jenmi to a person called kudiyan in respect of a Jenmam land on receipt by the jenmi of an amount as loan, called Kanam. <span style="text-decoration:underline">The kudiyan has to pay a rent or pattom to the jenmi.</span> The jenmi has to pay interest in respect of the kanam money advanced. The net result is that the kudiyan pays to the jenmi the rent or pattom minus the interest and this residual rent is called michavaram. Besides this michavaram the kudiyan has also to pay certain customary dues and periodical fees. Under the Jenmi and Kudiyan Regulation as amended, <span style="text-decoration:underline">all these dues have been consolidated and their yearly value has been taken and fixed as the amount payable every year in lieu of all dues to the jenmi.</span> This is the jenmivaram and this law further lays down what shall be the rent payable and this is called the jenmikaram. The jenmikaram may be “said to be the statutory rent and the jenmivaram the contract rent, and it has been laid down that in the case of Jenmom lands generally jenmivaram shall be the jenmikaram. But in the case of cherikal lands a differential provision is made and it has been laid down that in respect of cherikal lands that jenmikaram shall be the settlement pattamicham minus the interest on the kanam amount. Perhaps I may have to explain what settlement pattamicham is. Honourable members know that settlement pattom is the pattern fixed by Government in respect of Sirkar lands in the settlement of tax. The Settlement Pattamicham means the settlement pattom fixed at the settlement minus the tax actually payable in respect of the land. In respect of cherikal lands what has been fixed is that the kudiyan shall pay to the jenmi the settlement pattamicham minus the interest on the kanam amount. It has been assumed that the settlement pattamicham is the utmost fair rent that may be paid by the kudiyan to the jenmi. But it has been noticed in actual fact that the interest on the kanam is more than the settlement pattamicham, with the result that in many cases the jenmikaram is nil or a minus quantity. This was not the intention of the Legislature. Therefore provision is now proposed, in this Bill, that in respect of cherikal lands either the jenmivaram or settlement pattamicham minus the interest on kanam amount shall be the jenmikaram whichever is greater. I am sure that this will be admitted to be a reasonable arrangement. This is the main principle of the Bill.”</li>

<p>Our Apex Court in <strong>Kannan Devan Hills Produce Company Ltd. v.

<p>On 2.8.1886, the agreement called the <strong>Second Pooniat Concession</strong> was entered into modifying the previous deed of ratification. By this time a company called the North Travancore Land Planting and Agricultural Society Ltd. had acquired the rights in the said land.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">Surrender of rights to Travancore Sircar</span></strong><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong> &amp; Royal Proclamation of 1899</strong> </span></p>
<p>Poonjar Chief or Raja had subjugated himself to Travancore Sircar or Maharaja. <strong>Agreement</strong> dated 18.09.1899 was entered into between Rohini Thirunal Kerala Varma Raja (the then Chief of Poonjar Koyikkal) and the Travancore Government, under which the <strong>ownership of the land</strong> described in the First Poonjat Concession had been <strong>transferred to the Government of Travancore</strong>. (See: Kottayam District Koottu Krishi Karshakasangam v. Stateof Kerala, 2015). It was a surrender of certain rights of the Poonjar Chief in favour of Travancore Sircar. On 24.9.1899, a <strong>Royal Proclamation </strong>(of 1899) was made.</p>
<p>The Royal Proclamation made on 24.9.1899 read as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li class="has-small-font-size">“Whereas we deem it expedient to clearly declare the position of this State in respect of the tract known as Anjanad and Kannan Devan Hills, we are pleased to declare as follows; (1) The tract known as <strong><u>Anjanad and Kannan Devan Hills </u></strong>is an integral portion of our territory and <strong><u>all rights over it belong to and vest in us</u></strong>.</li>
<li class="has-small-font-size">(2) The inhabitants of the said tract and all others whom it may concern are hereby informed and warned that they are <span style="text-decoration: underline">not to pay any taxes, rents or dues, or make any other payment to the Poonjar Chief </span>or his representatives or to any person other than an officer of our Government authorised in this behalf, in respect of anything in, upon or connected with the said tract, with the exception, <span style="text-decoration: underline">however</span>, of a payment of rupee three thousand per annum from the successors in interests of the late <strong><u>Mr. J.D.

<li class="has-small-font-size">(3) The lands within the said tract will be dealt with by our Government in the same manner as lands in other parts of our  territory with such modifications as the circumstances and conditions of the said tract may require and all taxes, rents and dues hitherto paid, and that may hereafter be imposed by our Government shall, with the exception of the sum of rupees three thousand aforesaid, be paid by the, occupants of lands within the said tract whose occupation has been or may be recognized or confirmed by our Government, and of such portions of the said tract as may from time to time hereafter, with the permission of our Government, be occupied, to the officers of our Government who may be authorised in this behalf.”  (Quoted in: Kannan Devan Hills Produce Company Ltd. v. State of Kerala, AIR 1972 SC 2301, 1972-2 SCC 218;  Kottayam District Koottu Krishi Karshakasangam v. Stateof Kerala, 2015)</li>
</ul>
<p>The Apex Court, in <strong>Kannan Devan Hills Produce Company Ltd. v. State of Kerala</strong>, AIR 1972 SC 2301, 1972-2 SCC 218, considered the effect of this surrender, with reference of its previous judgment in <strong>Kavalappara Kottarathil Kochuni v. State of Madras, </strong>(1960 (3) SCR 887) and observed, on the materials placed before the Court, that  it was difficult to resist the conclusion that the lands in dispute (with the Poonjar Chief) fall within the expression ‘<strong>Janmam right</strong>‘; and that the effect of the <strong>Royal Proclamation of 1899</strong> was that the <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline"><mark class="has-inline-color has-primary-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Sircar became the Janmi</mark></span></strong>. In Kannan Devan Hills Produce Company Ltd. v. State of Kerala, AIR 1972 SC 2301, 1972-2 SCC 218 our Apex Court observed as under: </p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“It seems to us that on the material placed before us it is difficult to resist the conclusion that the lands in dispute fall within the expression “Janmam right”. If, as stated in Travancore Land Revenue Manual Volume IV, <mark class="has-inline-color has-primary-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">there are <strong>no lands that do not belong to a Janmi</strong></mark><strong>, and the </strong><mark class="has-inline-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#290ee7"><strong>Sircar becomes a janmi by gift, escheat, confiscation </strong>or otherwise</mark>, <span style="text-decoration: underline">the effect of the Royal Proclamation of 1899 must be that the </span><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">Sircar became the Janmi</span>.</strong>“</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">Kannan Devan Hills (Resumption of Lands) Act, 1971</span></strong></p>
<p>For revenue purposes, janmam lands were lands that were entered in the revenue accounts under the heads of Devaswom-vaka, Brahmamaswom-vaka and Madampimar-vaka, i.e., to say a land to be classed as Janmom land should have been recognised as such in the revenue accounts. The mere circumstance that a land belongs to a janmi does not bring it under janmom tenure and conversely the mere fact that janmom land is absolutely transferred to a non janmi does not any the less detract from its original character. </p>
<p>The Apex Court in <strong>Kannan Devan Hills Produce Company Ltd. v. State of Kerala</strong>, AIR 1972 SC 2301, 1972-2 SCC 218, observed that, the <strong>State grants </strong>like Kannan Devan Hills Concession and Ten square Miles Concession and Munro Lands, were treated under the heading ‘<strong>Pandaravaka Lands</strong>‘, i.e., lands belonging to the Sircar. (See: Kottayam District Koottu Krishi Karshakasangam v. Stateof Kerala, 2015)</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline">Government of Kerala</span>, successor of the former Government of Travancore, was vested with the right, title and interest of the former Government.</p>
<p>The Kerala Government found that a large extent of agricultural lands in Kannan Devan Hills Village had not been converted into plantations and such lands are not required for the purpose of existing plantations. Accordingly, the Government decided to resume such lands for distribution for cultivation and purposes ancillary thereto. Consequent to this, Kannan Devan Hills (Resumption of Lands) Act, 1971 was enacted.  (Kottayam District Koottu Krishi Karshakasangam v. Stateof Kerala, 2015)</p>
<p>Constitution Bench of our Apex Court, in <strong>Kannan Devan Hills Produce Company Ltd. v. State of Kerala</strong>, AIR 1972 SC 2301, 1972-2 SCC 218, upheld the Kannan Devan Hills (Resumption of Lands) Act.</p>
<p>As already explained, while perusing the nature of <strong>‘janmam right’ </strong>it was held by our Apex Court in Kavalappara Kottarathil Kochuni v. State of Madras, 1960-3 S.C.R. 887, Subba Rao, J., as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“Under the definition, any janmam right in Kerala is an “estate”. A <strong><u>janmam right is the</u></strong> <strong><u>freehold interest</u></strong> in a property situated in Kerala. Moor in his “Malabar Law and Custom” describes it as a hereditary proprietorship. A janmam interest may, therefore, be described as “<strong><u>proprietary interest of a landlord in lands</u></strong>“, and such a janmam right is described as “<strong>estate</strong>” in the Constitution.” (Quoted in Kannan Devan Hills Produce Company Ltd. v. State of Kerala, AIR 1972 SC 2301, 1972-2 SCC 218)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><u>Kerala Grants and Leases (Modification of Rights) Act, 1980</u></strong> </p>
<p>Kerala Grants and Leases (Modification of Rights) Act, 1980 was enacted with a view to modify the rights under grants and leases, for cultivation, made by the former States of Travancore and Cochin. The Act was made for the reason that such grants and leases brought about heavy loss to the Government and they resulted in huge un-earned profits to the grantees and lessees; and it was found necessary in the public interest that such undue profits to a few person were to be utilised for the common benefit of the general public. The Act required the Grantees and lessees to pay current seigniorage rates (for the trees cut by the grantees and leases) and rent to the Government. The Collector was authorised to revise assessment and rent.</p>

<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“It seems to us that the <span style="text-decoration:underline">basic concept of the word ‘estate’ is that the person holding the estate should be proprietor of the soil</span> and should be in direct relationship with the State paying land revenue to it except where it is remitted in whole or in part”.</li>
</ul>
<p>In Govindaru Nambooripad v.

<li>“20. It cannot be disputed that these Jenmis and Devaswoms had full proprietary right in the soil and that the lands in which they have ‘Jenmom rights’ are ‘Estates’ within the definition of the word in Article 31-A.”</li>

<li>2. Overruling Govindaru Nambooripad v. State of Kerala, it was held in Rev. Fr. Victor Fernandez v. Albert Fernandez, 1971 Ker LT 1;  AIR 1971 Ker 168, that Pandarapattom land in the Travancore area of the State was ‘estate’ within the meaning of Article 31-A(2)(a).</li>

<p>In Purushothaman Nambudiri v. State of Kerala, AIR 1962 SC 694, the Supreme Court held <sub>(by majority, P.B. Gajendragadkar, A.K. Sarkar, K.N. Wanchoo, K.C. Das Gupta; and N. Rajagopala Ayyangar, dissenting) </sub>that Pandarappattom properties come within ‘estate’ under Article 31A of the Constitution. The Apex Court considered the proclamation issued by his Highness Sir Rama Varma Raja of Cochin on March 10, 1905. Clause 13 that rendered ‘full rights to the soil of the lands they hold’.</p>
<p>The Supreme Court (majority) held, with respect to Cochin Regulation, 1905 as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“It would thus be seen that under clause 13 t<span style="text-decoration:underline">he person holding lands on the Pandaravaka Verumpattom tenure is not a tenant. He is given the proprietary right in the soil itself,</span> subject of course to the rights as to metals and minerals reserved in favour of the State, indeed, the whole scheme of the new Proclamation appears to be to change the character of the possession of the Pandaravaka Verumpattom tenure-holder from that of a tenant into that of a proprietor-holder. It is true that he is made liable to pay half of the net produce and that may appear to be a little too high, but the measure of the levy will not convert what is intended to be a recovery of assessment Into a recovery of rent. The proprietor of the land held on Verumpattom tenure is nevertheless a proprietor of the land and he holds the land subject to his liability to pay the assessment to the State. It is not difficult to imagine that in a fairly large number of lands held by Pandaravaka Verumpattom tenure-holders the holders in turn would let out the the lands to the cultivators and thus would come into existence a local equivalent of the class of intermediaries. Land revenue record is required to be prepared by the Proclamation and relevant entries showing the extent of the properties belonging to the respective holders and the details about their liability to pay the assessment are intended to be shown in the said record. In our opinion, it would <span style="text-decoration:underline"><strong>not be reasonable</strong> to hold that the ‘lands held by the petitioner under the Pandaravaha Verumpattom tenure <strong>do not confer on him the proprietary right at all </strong>but make him a tenant of the State</span>“.</li>
</ul>
<p>But, N. Rajagopala Ayyangar, J., while descending, observed as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“In this connection I might usefully refer to a <span style="text-decoration:underline">proclamation of the ruler of Travancore of 1865 (1040 M. E.) regarding Sarkar-pattom lands</span>, with the observation that subject to variations dependent on local usages, the system of land tenure and the concepts as regards the rights of property in land were substantially similar in Travancore and Cochin. <span style="text-decoration:underline">Sarkar-pattom lands were what might be termed ‘Crown lands’ of which the ruler was deemed to be the Jenmi or the landlord.</span> Previous to the proclamation the lands were legally capable of being resumed by the ruler, though this was seldom done and the cultivators were not legally entitled to transfer their rights and where this was done the Government had the right to ignore the transaction. <span style="text-decoration:underline">The fact that the cultivator was conceived of as having no proprietary interest on the land</span> also bore adversely on the State since the State was deprived of the means of realising any arrears of revenue by bringing the holding to sale. It was to remedy this situation that the proclamation was issued and the preamble and its terms carry the impress of the impact of the ryotwari system of Madras.”</li>
</ul>
<p>After referring the 1040 (1865) Proclamation, Ayyangar, J. said as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“The language employed in the proclamation is of significance. <span style="text-decoration:underline">It speaks of the relinquishment or withdrawal of the right of the State and not of the conferment of a right on the ryot </span>so as to render the ryot a grantee from the State, just in line with the Hindu Law theory of the proprietorship of the soil vesting in the occupant-cultivator.”</li>
</ul>
<p>In <span style="text-decoration:underline">Govindaru Nambooripad v. State of Kerala, AIR 1963 Ker 86 </span>(FB), in spite of the decision in Purushothaman Nambudiri v. State of Kerala, AIR 1962 SC 694 (pertained to Cochin), it was held that <span style="text-decoration:underline">Pandarapattom</span> (or Pandaravaka pattom) lands in the Travancore area cannot have the protection of Article 31A of the Constitution. Analysing the 1040 ME Travancore Proclamation, it was held by the High Court as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“11. The provisions of the Proclamation do not, in our opinion, confer on the tenants absolute proprietary rights in the soil. <span style="text-decoration:underline">There is no clause by which the Sirkar parted with all rights in favour of the tenants</span> and in the absence of such a provision, the holders of such lands can only be treated as holding such lands on perpetual leases.”</li>

State of Kerala, 2018-2 KHC 719; 2018-2 KLT 369).</p>
<p>It was found in Rev. Fr. Victor Fernandez case that by the<span style="text-decoration: underline"> Proclamation of 1040 (1865 AD), all Sircar-pattom-lands were converted into full proprietary-lands</span>, and rights on tenants of Pandarapattom lands had thenceforth been conferred with proprietary-rights.  </p>
<p>In Rev. Fr. Victor Fernandez v. Albert Fernandez, 1971 Ker LT 1, AIR 1971 Ker 168, it was observed as under:</p>
<p>Per PT Raman Nayar, CJ, T Krishnamoorthy Iyer, P Unnikrishna Kurup, JJ.:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“11.  …. We have already shown how, in the face of the Proclamation of 1040, it is impossible to regard the holders of these lands as tenants in the strict sense of that term having only the right to enjoy the land and no interest in the land as such. We have also drawn attention to the fact that what <span style="text-decoration:underline">they pay to the Government is, under the very terms of the Proclamation, assessment or land tax, in other words, land revenue, and not rent</span> properly so-called. As stated in 1962 Ker LT 913 = (AIR 1963 Ker 86 FB). with reference to contemporary documents, the avowed purpose of the <span style="text-decoration:underline">Proclamation of 1040 was to place pandarapattam lands on the same footing as ryotwari lands in the neighbouring province of Madras</span>, and wo have no doubt that it succeeded in doing so. If the relations between the holder of a land and the Government are placed on the same footing as the relations between the holder of ryotwari land and the Government, it seems to us that it necessarily follows that the land is held under ryotwari settlement–it is the factual relationship and not the label that counts and no concept of legal rights is involved. …. </li>
</ul>
<p>Per KK Mathew, J.</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>17……. <span style="text-decoration:underline">To my mind the terms of the Proclamation leave no doubt that full proprietary interest has been conferred upon the holders of pandarapattom lands</span>. ….Clause (2) is the pivotal clause; and it provides that the ryots holding such lands may regard them fully private, saleable and otherwise heritable and transferable property. Clause (4) guarantees the continued undisturbed enjoyment of the land so long as the appointed assessment is paid. Clause (6) makes it clear that the lands will be resumable by the State like other jenmom or private land only for public purpose and when resumed for such purposes compensation will be paid by the Sirkar not only for the improvements but also for the full market value of the property. Clause (7) provided that the rights conferred by the Proclamation would not in any way affect the right of the Sirkar to regulate land tax or to resume escheats or to confiscate the property of criminals. Clauses (6) and (7) are very significant. <span style="text-decoration:underline">What are reserved to the Sirkar by Clauses (6) and (7) are not anv proprietary rights in the land. The rights which inhere in every sovereign in respect of every property within his jurisdiction like eminent domain,</span> the right to impose or regulate tax, to resume escheats, to confiscate property of criminals, are alone reserved by those clauses. They not only do not derogate from the grant of full proprietary interest made by Clauses (1), (2) and (4), but would highlight that no proprietary rights have been reserved to the State. If the sovereign was careful to <span style="text-decoration:underline">reserve to himself in respect of these lands only those rights which appertain to sovereignty and not any right which relates to dominium</span>, that is a clear indication that no right relating to dominium was intended to be retained by the Sirkar. Even if the clauses were absent, the Sirkar would have those rights as they appertain to sovereignty and not to dominium. In other words, if by way of abundant caution the clauses reserved to the Sirkar only rights which appertain to sovereignty, there was absolutely no reason why the rights, if any, relating to dominium or ownership were not reserved, if the sovereign intended to retain any right in respect of the lands.….. I think, a holder of <span style="text-decoration:underline">pandarapattom land satisfies even the orthodox definition   of ownership by Austin</span>.   Austin defines the right of ownership as a–“right indefinite in point of user, unrestricted in point of disposition, and unlimited in point of duration, over a determinate thing.” (See ‘Jurisprudence’ by Austin, 3rd Edn., page 817.) </li>
<li>19. The basic concept of ‘estate’ is that the person holding the estate should be the proprietor of the soil and should be in direct relationship with the State by paying land revenue to it except where it is remitted in whole or in part. See AIR 1962 SC 694. As I have said the pattom Proclamation conferred full proprietary rights on tenants of pandarapattom lands, and they are also in direct relation with the State by paying land revenue. Since there is no definition of the word ‘estate’ in the existing local law relating to land tenure, pandarapattom land is the local equivalent of ‘estate,’ because its attributes conform to the basic concept of the term.”</li>

<p>In Purushothaman Nambudiri v. State of Kerala, AIR 1962 SC 694, the Supreme Court (Rajagopala Ayyankar, J. Minority) pointed out the requirement and <span style="text-decoration: underline">purport of these Proclamations</span>. It reads as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“The evils which the system gave rise to, the economic insecurity of the tenant and the consequent lack of incentive on his part to put his best exertion on the land and the resultant loss to the state in the shape of revenue as well as the rise of a contented peasantry were exactly parallel to the situation which faced the ruler of Travancore leading to the proclamation of 1865. It was in these circumstances that the ruler of Cochin issued a proclamation on March 10, 1905, which defined with precision the rights of the State and of the cultivator in regard to these lands …”</li>
</ul>
<p> Ayyankar, J. (Minority) observed that there was “<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">conferment</span></strong> of proprietary rights by the Cochin Proclamation of 1905″ and “<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">relinquishment</span></strong> by the State under the Travancore Proclamation of 1865″.</p>
<p>Finally, the Majority held that by virtue of the Cochin Proclamation of 1905 the holders of the Pandaravaka-verumpattom lands in Cochin were holding the property as “estate”  within the meaning of Article 31A of the Constitution, and that the challenge thereon (to the Kerala Agrarian Relations Act, 1961) was not sustainable.</p>
<p><strong><u>Kesavananda Bharati Case</u></strong></p>
<p>29<sup>th</sup> Amendment of the Constitution of India put Kerala Land Reforms Amendment Act, 1969 and Kerala Land Reforms (Amendment) Act, 1971, in IX<sup>th</sup> schedule. It was argued in Kesavananda Bharati case, known is as ‘Fundamental Rights Case’ [His Holiness Kesavananda Bharati Sripadagalvaru v. State of Kerala: AIR 1973 SC 1461] that the amendments, that took away or abridged ‘fundamental rights’, were invalid.</p>
<p>Kesavananda Bharati case is one of the most important cases taken up by the Supreme Court of India. Largest ever bench of the Supreme Court (13 judges) considered it.  Kesavananda credits the longest ever hearing in the history of the Supreme Court; it took 66 days, spread over to 5 months.</p>
<p><strong><u>Points considered</u></strong></p>
<p>The 13 judge bench was constituted to consider whether <em>Golak Nath </em>[IC Golak Nath v. State of Punjab: AIR 1967 SC 1643] was correctly decided. It had been held in <em>Golak Nath, </em>by an 11 judge bench, that the Parliament could not amend fundamental rights guaranteed in Part III of the Constitution.</p>
<p><strong><u>Rival contentions:</u></strong></p>
<p>Nani A Palkhivala led arguments for the petitioners. He emphasized:</p>
<ol class="wp-block-list" start="1">
<li>Article 368 (Provision for amendment of the Constitution) does not override Article 13(2). The power of the Parliament to amend the Constitution is derived from Articles 245, 246 and 248 of the Constitution and not from Article 368 which only deals with procedure.</li>
<li>The word <em>‘amendment’</em> has ‘limited’ meaning (something can be modified but without change of core) and there are ‘inherent<em><u>and implied limitations’</u></em>  to abrogate or repeal the Constitution (though not express; inherent in Constitution itself) for altering the essential features or basic structure of Constitution. It was explained by Palkhivala as under: “The principle of inherent and implied limitations means: deducing that is left unsaid from what is said, and perceiving what is implicit in the express provision and scheme of the instrument”. </li>
<li> Palkhivala argued against unlimited amending power elucidating the essential features of our constitution, which included sovereignty, the republican form of government, the federal structure and the fundamental rights (as a whole). They were unchangeable.  Founding fathers of the Constitution considered fundamental rights as ‘fundamental’.  </li>
<li>The Constitution is supreme. The Parliament is a creature of Constitution. Therefore, the Parliament cannot increase the power conferred to it or destroy essential/basic feature or basic structure of the Constitution. That is, there is implied limitation for the Parliament. </li>
<li>The Preamble of the Constitution limits ‘unlimited power<strong>’</strong> of the Parliament. </li>
<li>If Parliament has unlimited power, it can make judiciary and executive completely subordinate or take over their powers.</li>
<li>Ultimate power is vested with ‘<em>We, the people’</em>. </li>
<li>The Constitution gives the Indian citizen freedoms which are to subsist for ever. If Article 31C is valid, Parliament and State Legislatures, and not the Constitution, will determine how much freedom is good for the citizens.</li>
</ol>
<p>H.M. Seervai (for State of Kerala) and Niren De (Attorney General) stood for unlimited amending power.  They stressed the following:</p>
<ol class="wp-block-list" start="1">
<li>Unless there are no express words, or compelling implication from the existing provisions, for limiting extent of amendment, then there will be no implied limitation.</li>
<li>Government is duty bound to give effect to Directive principles (Part IV of the Constitution) and to enact ‘Laws’ to achieve those objectives<strong>.</strong></li>
<li>The acceptance of concepts like ‘<em><u>implied limitation’</u></em>, which have no definite contours, would introduce uncertainty and vagueness. </li>
<li>No test can be applied to essential or non-essential feature.  </li>
<li> The constituent assembly made no distinction between essential and non-essential features.</li>
<li>None in the constituent assembly said – fundamental rights could not be amended. </li>
<li>The expression ‘an amendment of this Constitution’ in Article 368 meant amendment of each and every provisions of Constitution. Article 368 not only prescribes the procedure but also gives the power of amendment   </li>
<li> If Constitution-makers intended that the fundamental rights should override Article 368, it is reasonable to assume that they would have made an express provision to that effect.  The Preamble cannot control the unambiguous language of the articles of the Constitution. The Constitution of India is one of the lengthiest Constitutions, if not the lengthiest of the world. </li>
<li>The expression ‘fundamental’ does not lift the fundamental rights above Constitution itself.</li>
<li>There is distinction between Constituent power and legislative power.  Article 13(2) pertains to legislative power alone. </li>
<li> The Constitution did not envisage a constituent assembly, in future, to abridge or change fundamental rights.</li>
</ol>
<p>Palkhivala contended that wide power to amend the Constitution would result ‘in liquidation of Constitution’. Attorney General (Niren De) retorted that ‘unambiguous meaning of amendment’ should not be destroyed ‘to nurse the theory of implied limitation’.</p>
<p><strong><u>Final outcome of Kesavananda Bharati</u></strong></p>
<p>It is a never ending controversy.</p>
<p>13 Judges delivered 11 judgments. (There were two ‘common judgments’.) In the paper titled “<em><u>View by the Majority</u></em>” signed by Chief Justice (S.M.Sikri) and other 8 Judges (9 only) contained six points. It stated:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>(1) </strong>Golak Nath case is overruled. </li>
<li><strong>(2)</strong> Article 368 does not enable Parliament to alter the <em><u>basic structure</u> or frame work</em> of the Constitution. </li>
<li><strong>(3)</strong> The Constitution (Twenty-fourth Amendment) Act, 1971 is valid. (It was passed to get over Golek Nath.) </li>
<li><strong>(4) </strong>Section 2(a) and 2(b) of the Constitution (Twenty-fifth Amendment) Act, 1971 is valid. (It pertained to ‘right to property’. Art. 31 &amp; 19(1)(f) and Added Art. 31C.) </li>
<li><strong>(5)</strong> The first part of Section 3 of the Constitution (Twenty-fifth Amendment) Act, 1971 is valid. (New Article 31C provided: [first part] the laws which give effect to Directive Principles will not be void on the allegation that it is inconsistent with certain fundamental rights.) The second part, namely, “and no law containing a declaration that it is for giving effect to such policy shall be called in question in any Court on the ground that it does not give effect to such policy” is invalid. </li>
<li><strong>(6)</strong> The Constitution (29<sup>th</sup> Amendment) Act, 1971 is valid. (It put Kerala Acts in the 9<sup>th</sup> Schedule.)</li>
<li>The Constitution bench will determine the validity of the Constitution (Twenty-sixth amendment) Act, 1971 in accordance with law. (It related to abolition of privy purses and privileges of princes.)</li>

</ol>
<p>Khanna, J. took ‘Midway’ [as qualified by Palkhivala in (1974) 4 SCC Journal 57]</p>
<p>Khanna, J. rejected argument on ‘essential features’ and ‘implied limitation’ &amp; proceeded on ‘basic structure doctrine’ alone. He held: power of amendment extends to all Articles including fundamental rights; and only restriction is that the basic structure of the Constitution should not be changed.</p>
<p><strong><u>No essential features</u></strong>; <strong><u>No implied limitation</u></strong></p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>All Sikri (CJ) – led 6 Judges held: Fundamental rights could not be abrogated, (though they could be <em>abridged</em>, by amendment).</li>
<li>CJ, Sikri led judges (except Jaganmohan, J) accepted argument of Adv. Palkhivala that the fundamental rights are<em> <u>essential features</u></em> of the Constitution and that there was <em><u>implied limitation</u></em> to change or amend the fundamental rights. </li>
<li>J. Ray led 6 judges were of the definite opinion that there was no limitation at all to amend the Constitution and therefore fundamental rights also could be ‘amended’ – it could be abrogated or repealed.</li>
<li>Khanna J discarded both ‘essential features’ theory  and ‘implied limitation’ theory; and held: fundamental rights also could be ‘<em><u>added, altered or repealed</u></em>’.</li>
<li>Therefore, majority (J. Ray led judges <strong>+</strong> Khanna, J.) decision emerged was that: There was “<em><u>no implied limitation</u></em>” to amend the Constitution; that is, even the fundamental rights could be ‘<em><u>repealed</u></em>’</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><u>Khanna J. ‘Tipped the scales’</u></strong></p>
<p>Kesavananda Bharati is <em>fundamental right</em>’s case. The crux was whether fundamental rights could be ‘amended’. CJ. Sikri-led six judges stood for limited power of the Parliament to amend the Constitution. They held – fundamental rights could not be abrogated or repealed.  Broadly speaking, J. Khanna joined with them for he held: Parliament has <em><u>no unlimited power</u></em> to amend the Constitution.</p>
<p> J. Khanna also joined six J. Ray-led judges when he held – fundamental rights also <em><u>could be repealed</u></em>.  Therefore the majority decision turned out was that fundamental rights are also subject to ‘amendment power’ of the Parliament.</p>
<p>Finally the ‘mid-way’ stance of J. Khanna ‘tipped the scales’ in favour of CJ. Sikri-led-judges which paved way to emerge <em><u>basic structure</u></em> doctrine as the ‘essential feature’ of Kesavananda.</p>
<p><strong><u>Final outcome – ‘Basic Structure Doctrine’: But, No Common Ratio?</u></strong></p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Khanna, J. asserted: Art. 368 cannot be “so construed as to embody the death-wish of the Constitution or provide sanction for what may perhaps be called lawful hara-kiri”. </li>
<li>It is clear that Khanna, J. propounded ‘<strong><em>basic structure</em></strong>’ doctrine not in the way that was upheld by Sikri (CJ.) led  judges. It was not in the way exactly argued by Palkhivala also. For discarding the ‘implied limitation’ theory and ‘essential features’ theory (these theories were accepted by Sikri-led judges), Khanna, J. accepted the arguments of Seervai and Attorney General in this regard. But, finally, by the ‘View by the Majority’ signed by nine judges, the view (minority?) of Khanna, J. (<em>ie. basic structure doctrine</em>) was emerged as the ‘ratio’ of the case.</li>
<li>Seervai in his treatise ‘Constitutional Law of India’ stated as under, on page 1626:  “If the ‘fundamental rights case’ is stood by itself, it was <em><u>possible to argu</u>e</em> that the judgment of 7 Judges [Sikri (CJ) led judges <strong>+</strong> Khanna, J.] as to the basic structure disclosed no common ratio”.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><u>Even CJ. Sikri-led-judges ‘diluted’ fundamental rights</u></strong></p>
<p>CJ. Sikri led (6) judges (six only) held definitely that fundamental rights were not liable to be <em><u>abrogated</u></em> by amendment; and it is very important to note that even these 6 judges held that the fundamental rights were subject to reasonable <em><u>abridgement</u></em>, in the public interest; and the power of ‘<em>amendment’</em> reached every part and every article of the Constitution, provided the basic foundation or structure remained the same. All these judges (also) varied from Golak Nath which unconditionally held – fundamental rights cannot be varied/ amended.</p>
<p><strong><u>Did Khanna J. hold <em>every ‘</em>fundamental right’ was part of basic structure?</u></strong></p>
<p>Justice Khanna held the following in his Judgment:  “Subject to the retention of the basic structure or frame work of the Constitution, I have no doubt (i) that the power of amendment is plenary and (ii) would include within itself the power to add, alter or repeal the various articles including those relating to <em><u>fundamental rights</u> </em> as well as which may be said to relate to essential features”.</p>
<p>Divergent views as to Judgment of Khanna, J.:</p>
<ol class="wp-block-list" start="1">
<li>Khanna, J. <em><u>did not hold</u></em>– fundamental rights were part of basic structure.  Seervai stated as under in ‘Constitutional Law of India’ (Page 1625) – “His (Khanna, J.) Judgment was capable of being read to mean that according to him fundamental rights (as such) were not a part of the basic structure of our Constitution and it was so read by Chandrachud, J. in the <em>Election case</em> (Indira Nehru Gandhi v. Raj Narayan)”. (The idea conveyed is that, by ‘basic structure’ it brought-in broad aspects like ‘democracy, sovereignty, federalism’ etc. and it is not confined to any specific Part or Article.)</li>
<li>Khanna J. held– fundamental rights <em><u>might be</u></em> <em>part </em>of basic structure. Bhagawati, J., in Minerva Mills case [AIR 1980 SC 1789], pointed out that Khanna, J. did not hold that fundamental rights (<em>as such</em>) were not a part of the basic structure. Bhagawati, J. observed: “The very fact that Khanna, J. proceeded to consider this question (<em>whether right to property, appertained to basic structure</em>) shows beyond doubt that he did not hold that fundamental rights (<em>as such</em>) were not part of the basic structure; but so far as other fundamental rights were concerned, he left the question open”.</li>
<li>Khanna J. held – fundamental rights <em><u>were part </u></em>of basic structure. Khanna, J. himself, also, had ‘explained’ in <em>Election Case</em> (Indira Nehru Gandhi v. Raj Narayanan, AIR 1975 SC 2299) as under:
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“It is difficult to read anything in my judgment to justify the conclusion that fundamental rights (<em>as such)</em> were not part of the basic structure”. </li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong><u>What was the dictum on ‘right to property’?</u></strong></p>
<p>The following two majority findings in Kesavananda are important:</p>
<ol class="wp-block-list" start="1">
<li>  <em>The right of the Parliament to amend the Constitution is limited.  There are certain essential features or basic structure which cannot be discarded. (Sikri (CJ) led judges + Khanna J)</em></li>
<li><em>  Fundamental rights are also open to ‘amendment’. (J. Ray led judges + Khanna J)</em></li>
</ol>
<p>In the light of the aforesaid two majority findings the following decision of Khanna, J. (single Judge) emerges as a declaration/ dictum (having force of law under Art. 141 of the Constitution) of Kesavananda on the right to property: <em> “Right to property in Art. 19(1)(f) does not form part of the basic structure”(so that it cannot be amended).</em></p>
<p>For the finding of Khanna, J. that right to property did not form part of the basic structure (though a fundamental right) the Constitutional validity of the Kerala Land Reforms (Amendment) Act, 1971 stood upheld.</p>
<p><strong><u>Conclusion</u></strong></p>
<p>The Kerala Land Reforms Act, 1963 was not a sporadic one. There were several pre-independent enactments that paved the way to the Act. The Kerala Agrarian Relations Bill, 1957 of the ‘Communist Government’ was a post-independent land-mark mile-stone in that line.  The courts in India, especially the Supreme Court of India, supported the wisdom of the Parliament in Land Reform measures observing that they were in concordance with the Constitution of India.</p>
