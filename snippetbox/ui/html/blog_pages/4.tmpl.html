<p><strong><u>Suit under Sec. 6 Sp. Rlf. Act is a ‘Summary’ one, for Three Reasons</u></strong></p>
<p>A suit filed under Sec. 6 (Specific Relief Act) is said to be a ‘Summary Suit’. It is for three reasons:</p>
<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li>No adjudication on title.</li>
<li>Only issue germane is whether ‘illegal dispossession’.</li>
<li>No Appeal or Review from the Judgment thereon.</li>
</ol>
<p>It is noteworthy that it is not a suit that falls under Order XXXVII CPC (‘Summary Procedure’).</p>
<p><strong><u>Sec. 6, Specific Relief </u></strong><strong><u>Act</u></strong></p>
<p>Sec. 6, Specific Relief Act, reads as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“6. <span style="text-decoration: underline">Suit by person dispossessed of immovable property</span>.—(1) If any person is dispossessed without his consent of immovable property otherwise than in due course of law, he or any person through whom he has been in possession or any person claiming through him may, by suit, recover possession thereof, notwithstanding any other title that may be set up in such suit. </li>
<li>(2) No suit under this section shall be brought— (a) after the expiry of six months from the date of dispossession; or (b) against the Government. </li>
<li>(3) No appeal shall lie from any order or decree passed in any suit instituted under this section, nor shall any review of any such order or decree be allowed. </li>
<li>(4) Nothing in this section shall bar any person from suing to establish his title to such property and to recover possession thereof.”</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><u>What is Section 6 of the Specific Relief Act, 1963</u></strong></p>
<p>When attracted?</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>A person (in actual possession) has been dispossessed. </li>
<li>From an immovable property.</li>
<li>Without his consent and.</li>
<li>Otherwise than in due course of law.  </li>
</ul>
<p>Who can file a suit?</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Person who has been dispossessed or </li>

<li>Any person claiming through him </li>
</ul>
<p>What should be the suit for?</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Recover possession of the immoveable property.</li>
</ul>
<p>What are the characteristics of such a suit?</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>It is a special remedy, notwithstanding any other title the plaintiff may have, or he could set up. </li>
<li>The must be brought within the six months of dispossession.</li>
<li>No appeal shall lie from any order or decree passed; there will be no review also. </li>
<li>This section does not bar the person dispossessed (etc.) to file a suit to establish his title and to recover possession thereof.</li>
<li>No suit can be filed against the Government under this section. </li>
<li>Sec. 6(4) of the Sp. Relief Act will not preclude the defendant from recovering the property based on title.</li>
<li>A suit under Sec. 6 is maintainable even against the true owner of the property.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><u>Sec. 6 – Only Issue – Whether Plaintiff Illegally Dispossessed</u></strong></p>
<p>In I.T.C.  Limited v. Adarsh Co-op.  Housing Soc.  Ltd., 2013-10 SCC 169, it is observed that “illegal dispossession” is the only issue germane to a suit under Sec. 6.  It is held as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“In fact, in a suit under Section 6, the only question that has to be determined by the Court is whether the plaintiff was in possession of the disputed property and he had been illegally dispossessed therefrom on any date within six months prior to the filing of the suit. … As the question of possession and <span style="text-decoration: underline">illegal dispossession </span>therefrom is the <span style="text-decoration: underline">only issue germane</span> to a suit under Section 6, a proceeding thereunder, naturally, would partake the character of a summary proceeding against which the remedy by way of appeal or review has been specifically excluded by sub-Section 3 of Section 6. … (The Court referred to: Lallu Yashwant Singh v. Rao Jagdish Singh,  AIR 1968 SC 620, Krishna Ram Mahale v.  Shobha Venkat Rao, AIR 1989 SC 2097 and Sanjay Kumar Pandey v. Gulabahar Sheikh, 2004-4 SCC 664).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><u>Why Called “Summary Suit” – No Adjudication on Title and No Appeal</u></strong></p>
<p>In Sanjay Kumar Pandey v. Gulabahar Sheikh, 2004-4 SCC 664, it is explained as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“4. A suit under Section 6 of the Act is often called a summary suit inasmuch as the enquiry in the suit under Section 6 is confined to finding out the possession and dispossession within a period of six months from the date of the institution of the suit ignoring the question of <strong>title</strong><strong>.</strong> Sub-Section (3) of Section 6 provides that <strong><u>no appeal</u></strong> shall lie from any order or decree passed in any suit instituted under this section. No review of any such order or decree is permitted. The remedy of a person unsuccessful in a suit under Section 6 of the Act is to file a regular suit establishing his title to the suit property and in the event of his succeeding he will be entitled to recover possession of the property notwithstanding the adverse decision under Section 6 of the Act. Thus, as against a decision under Section 6 of the Act, the remedy of unsuccessful party is to file a suit based on title. The remedy of filing a revision is available but that is only by way of an exception; for the High Court would not interfere with a decree or order under Section 6 of the Act except on a case for interference being made out within the well-settled parameters of the exercise of revisional jurisdiction under Section 115 of the Code.” (Quoted in: I. T. C.  Limited v. Adarsh Co-op.  Housing Soc.  Ltd., 2013-10 SCC 169.)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">“Unjustly Denied by an Illegal Act <span style="text-decoration: underline"> of dispossession</span>”</span></strong></p>
<p>The Supreme Court, in Sanjay Kumar Pandey v. Gulbahar Sheikh, (2004) 4 SCC 664, held that Sec. 6 is to give immediate relief to the person who has been illegally dispossessed from the property. The Court held as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“A proceeding under Section 6 of the Specific Relief Act, 1963 is intended to be a summary proceeding the object of which is to afford an <span style="text-decoration: underline">immediate remedy</span> to an aggrieved party to reclaim possession of which he may have been <span style="text-decoration: underline">unjustly denied by an illegal act of dispossession</span>.” (Same words in Mohd. Mehtab Khan v. Khushnuma Ibrahim Khan, 2013 (9) SCC 221, also. Quoted in: P.  Thankamma v. Sajitha G.  Nair, 2014-2 KHC 151; 2014-2 KLT 110)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><u>Title or better possession not arise for Adjudication</u></strong></p>
<p>In I. T. C.  Limited v. Adarsh Co-op.  Housing Soc.  Ltd., 2013-10 SCC 169, it is observed by our Apex Court that Sec. 6 requires adjudication as to illegal dispossession of immovable property, independently of the question of title that may be set up by the defendant in such a suit.</p>
<p>In Mohd. Mehtab Khan v. Khushnuma Ibrahim Khan, 2013 (9) SCC 221, it is held as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“…. Questions of title or better rights of possession does not arise for adjudication in a suit under Section 6 where the only issue required to be decided is as to whether the plaintiff was in possession at any time 6 months prior to the date of filing of the suit. The legislative concern underlying Section 6 of the Specific Relief Act is to provide a quick remedy in cases of illegal dispossession so as to discourage litigants from seeking remedies outside the arena of law. The same is evident from the provisions of Section 6(3) which bars the remedy of an appeal or even a review against a decree passed in such a suit.” (Quoted in: P.  Thankamma v. Sajitha G.  Nair, 2014-2 KHC 151; 2014-2 KLT 110)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><u>“Dispossessed otherwise than in due course of law”</u></strong></p>
<p>In Sukhjeet Singh v. Sirajunnisa (Dipak Misra, J.), AIR 2001 MP 59, the tenant handed over the premises to the landlord for the marriage of the landlord’s son. The landlord did not return possession. It is held that possession under Section 6 is not attracted inasmuch as the possession was voluntarily transferred.</p>
<p><strong><u>Issue is Not Validity of Transaction; But Whether Dispossessed ‘Without His Consent’</u></strong></p>
<p>In Onama Glass Works Lid. v. Shri Ram Harak Panday, AIR 1966 Madh Pra 282, the Board of Directors of a Company by resolution transferred the companies property, but there was no resolution by the General Body. The Court, on considering the scope of Sec. 6, Sp. Relief Act, held as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“8. …. .This section becomes applicable only when the plaintiff is dispossessed ‘without his consent.’ The matter in issue is not whether the transaction was valid but whether the plaintiff was dispossessed ‘without his consent’. . . . .” (Quoted in: Sukhjeet Singh v. Sirajunnisa, AIR 2001 MP 59)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><u>If “An Iota of Consent”- Cannot Complain of Dispossession</u></strong></p>
<p>In Sukhjeet Singh v. Sirajunnisa, AIR 2001 MP 59, the learned Judge (as he then was) pointed out the facs of Neyveli Lignite Corporation Ltd. v. K.S. Narayan Iyer, AIR 1965 Madras 122, to establish that “there should not have been an iota of consent in handing over the possession”.</p>
<p>In the said case (Neyveli Lignite Corporation Ltd. v. K.S. Narayan Iyer) certain property was leased by the Corporation for running of a canteen. The lease was originally for one year. It was renewed thereafter; but declined any further. After the expiry of the notice period the authorities accompanied by Police took possession. The respondents did not protest. Later on he issued a notice to the Corporation calling upon it to pay damages failing which he threatened to take steps for recovery. There was no demand for restoration of possession. The High Court held that the respondent did not intend to hold the possession, and hence, he cannot complain of dispossession and claim relief under Section 9 (Section 6 of New Act) of the Specific Relief Act.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">Not to declare evicted person was in Lawful Possession</span> </strong></p>
<p>In M.C. Chockalingam v. Manickavasagam, AIR 1974 SC 104, the Apex Court observed as follows:–</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“13. … . All that Section 6 (new) of the Specific Relief Act provides is that a person, even if he is a landlord, cannot take the law into his own hands and forcibly evict a tenant after expiry of the lease. This section has relevance only to the wrongful act of a person, if it be by the landlord, in forcibly recovering possession of the property without recourse to law. Section 6 frowns upon forcible dispossession without recourse to law but does <span style="text-decoration: underline">not at </span>the same time declare that the <span style="text-decoration: underline">possession of the evicted person is a lawful possession</span>. . . .” (Quoted in: Sukhjeet Singh v. Sirajunnisa, AIR 2001 MP 59)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><u>Discretionary Revisional Jurisdiction</u></strong></p>
<p>In Sobhabati v. Lakshmi Chand, AIR 1984 Ori. 171, held that the High Court should not interfere in its discretionary revisional jurisdiction with a decision given under Section 6 of the Specific Relief Act as parties have effective remedy by way of suit for declaration of title and possession. (Referred to in Sukhjeet Singh v. Sirajunnisa, AIR 2001 MP 59)</p>
<p><strong><u>Can Sec. 6 suit be dismissed without trial</u></strong><strong>?</strong></p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Such a view would be a misapprehension of scope of the section. In such a situation the decision can be interfered in Revision. (Ajodhiya Prasad v. Ghasiram, AIR 1937 Nag. 326. Referred to in Sukhjeet Singh v. Sirajunnisa, AIR 2001 MP 59)</p>
<p><strong><u>Counter Claim to Set Aside Gift Deed in <strong><u>Sec. 6 Suit</u></strong> – Possible</u></strong></p>
<p>In P. Thankamma v. Sajitha G.  Nair, 2014-2 KHC 151; 2014-2 KLT 110, it is held that the court below had not erred in allowing I.A. for amending the written stat ement in order to set up by way of counter claim in the suit filed under Section 6 of the Act. It is observed as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“…. The enquiry in the suit under Section 6 of the Act and in the counter claim to set aside the Gift Deed vastly differs in its nature and scope. Also the decree in the suit is only open to challenge in a Civil Revision Petition whereas the decree in the counter claim is open to an appeal. But does it mean that a counter claim for setting aside the Gift Deed cannot be permitted to be set up in a suit for possession under Section 6 of the Act? I am afraid not since there is no such limitation to set up by way of counter claim under Order VIII Rule 6-A of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908.”</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><u>Doctrine of clean hands in claiming an equitable relief</u></strong></p>
<p>Halsbury’s Laws of England Fourth Edition Vol.-16 pages 874-876, lays down the legal position on the doctrine of clean hands in claiming an equitable relief as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>1305. He who comes into equity must come with clean hands. A court of equity refuses relief to a plaintiff whose conduct in regard to the subject matter of the litigation has been improper. This was formerly expressed by the maxim “he who has committed iniquity shall not have equity”, and relief was refused where a transaction was based on the plaintiff’s fraud or misrepresentation, or where the plaintiff sought to enforce a security improperly obtained, or where he claimed a remedy for a breach of trust which he had himself procured and whereby he had obtained money. Later it was said that the plaintiff in equity must come with perfect propriety of conduct, or with clean hands. In application of the principle a person will not be allowed to assert his title to property which he has dealt with so as to defeat his creditors or evade tax, for he may not maintain an action by setting up his own fraudulent design.</li>
<li>The maxim does not, however, mean that equity strikes at depravity in a general way; the cleanliness required is to be judged in relation to the relief sought, and the conduct complained of must have an immediate and necessary relation to the equity sued for; it must be depravity in a legal as well as in a moral sense. Thus, fraud on the part of a minor deprives him of his right to equitable relief notwithstanding his disability. Where the transaction is itself unlawful it is not necessary to have recourse to this principle. In equity, just as at law, no suit lies in general in respect of an illegal transaction, but this is on the ground of its illegality, not by reason of the plaintiff’s demerits.” (Quoted in: A. S.  Motors Pvt.  Ltd.  v. Union of India, 2013-10 SCC 114.)</li>
