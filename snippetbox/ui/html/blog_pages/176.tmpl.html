<li>First-hearing is <span style="text-decoration: underline">not</span> defined in the CPC. In Siraj Ahmad Siddiqui v. Shri Prem Nath Kapoor, AIR 1993 SC 2525, our Apex Court held as under:</li>
<li>“13.

<p>From the above, it is clear: </p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>The Form No. 7 and Form No. 12 (Appendix – C) notices are given by one party or his advocate to the other.</li>
<li>Order XII rule 8 Notice is – to produce and ‘<span style="text-decoration:underline">show court</span>’ only (as stated in Form No. 12). But, <mark class="has-inline-color has-foreground-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Order XI rule 15 states – notice can be given by one party to the other party ‘<span style="text-decoration:underline">to produce</span> document <span style="text-decoration:underline">for the inspection</span> of the party, or of his pleader, <span style="text-decoration:underline">and </span>to permit him or them </mark><span style="text-decoration:underline"><mark class="has-inline-color has-foreground-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">to take copies</mark> thereof</span>‘.</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline"><mark class="has-inline-color has-foreground-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Order XI rule 15</mark> is confined to documents referred to in<mark class="has-inline-color has-foreground-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"> pleadings</mark></span><mark class="has-inline-color has-foreground-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"> or affidavits.</mark> But, Order XI rule 8 is <span style="text-decoration:underline">not</span> so confined. </li>
<li>It is reasonable to conclude that this power given to a party (to give notice by one party to other – under Order XI rule 8) is to be exercised, normally, ‘<span style="text-decoration:underline">at the first hearing</span>‘ alone (see:  Form No. 12); and, even if it can be given effect to in a subsequent stage (by the orders of the court), it is only in exceptional circumstances. (The reason thereof is plain.)</li>
<li>It will also be rationale to infer that the Order XI rule 8 does not allow a party to see the document produced – for, Form No. 12 says as to  ‘<span style="text-decoration:underline">show court</span>’ only; and does not <mark class="has-inline-color has-foreground-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">allow ‘to produce document <span style="text-decoration:underline">for the inspection</span> of the party, or of his pleader, <span style="text-decoration:underline">and </span>to permit him or them </mark><span style="text-decoration:underline"><mark class="has-inline-color has-foreground-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">to take copies</mark> thereof</span>‘, as provided under Order XI rule 15. (The logic behind it is explicit.)</li>

<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">A Discordant Note – For, Inclusion of rule 8 in Order XII is Incongruent</span></strong></p>
<p>Order XII deals with ‘Admission’.  Rule 8  thereof hands out ‘Notice to produce documents’. It can be seen, on a plain reading, that rule 8 is not confined to “Admission”. Therefore, inclusion of rule 8 in Order XII is incongruent.  </p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline">No Adverse Presumption Possible</span></p>
<p>Is it possible to draw adverse presumption for non production of a document (in spite of notice under rule 8 in Order XII) is an interesting question.</p>
<p>The answer will be negative, when we go by provisions of CPC. They are the following:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>It only gives power to a party to give notice to other party; it does not require court intervention.</li>
<li>Order XII rule 8 Notice is – to produce and ‘<span style="text-decoration:underline">show court</span>’ only (as stated in Form No. 12)</li>
<li>It is directed to be exercised ‘<span style="text-decoration:underline">at the first hearing</span>‘ alone (see Form No. 12); and, in any case, even if it is possible to give effect to (by the court), in a subsequent stage, it can be done only in exceptional circumstances. </li>
<li>Under <strong><mark class="has-inline-color has-foreground-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Order XI</mark><mark class="has-inline-color has-primary-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"> </mark></strong>rule 15, where any party <span style="text-decoration:underline">fails to comply</span> with order for discovery or inspection of document, <span style="text-decoration:underline">the <mark class="has-inline-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#2e08f5">suit may be liable to be dismissed, </mark></span>and, if a defendant, <span style="text-decoration:underline">to have his <mark class="has-inline-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#101bfe">defence, if any struck out</mark></span>. Such stringent measures are not attached to non-compliance of Order XII rule 8.</li>
</ul>
<p>But, the provisions of the Evidence Act (Sec. 66) stipulates that ‘if the <mark class="has-inline-color has-foreground-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">adverse party knows that he will be Required to Produce’ a document,</mark> it is his duty to produce the document, even if it was not sought-for by notice. (Sec. 114 of the Evidence Act lay down the circumstances in which adverse presumption can be drawn when a document  – in possession – is not produced.)  Sec. 66 directs that the notice to produce such document must be “as prescribed by law, and if no notice is prescribed by law, then such notice as the Court considers reasonable under the circumstances of the case”.  </p>
<p>In view of the words in Sec. 66 of the Evidence Act as to the notice “prescribed by law”, in civil cases, the notice to be issued (for production of document) is that provided under Order XII rule 8.</p>

<p>Sec. 66 of the Evidence Act stipulates that secondary evidence of the documents shall not be permitted unless the party proposing to give such secondary evidence have given notice to the other party. But, the proviso to the section states, among other things, that when, from the nature of the case, the <span style="text-decoration:underline">adverse party</span> <span style="text-decoration:underline">knows that “he will be required to produce it</span>,” then such notice is not required.</p>

<p>In a proper case, the question – “Can you produce the document in court”, and the answer – “Yes”, will exonerate the party from giving a (formal) “<span style="text-decoration:underline">notice to the other party</span>” for it attracts – “<span style="text-decoration:underline">the <mark class="has-inline-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#0b15f6">adverse party </mark><mark class="has-inline-color has-foreground-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">must </mark><mark class="has-inline-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#0b15f6">know that he will be required to produce it</mark></span>“.  </p>
<p>Sec. 22 of the Evidence Act (<span style="text-decoration:underline">admissions as to contents of documents</span>) is also relevant here. It reads as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“22. <span style="text-decoration:underline">When oral admissions as to contents of documents are relevant</span>.—Oral admissions as to the contents of a document are not relevant, unless and until the party proposing to prove them shows that he is entitled to give secondary evidence of the contents of such document under the rules hereinafter contained, or unless the genuineness of a document produced is in question.”</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><u>Best Available Evidence must be Produced; If Not, Adverse Presumption will be Taken</u></strong></p>
<p>It may not be safe to a party to a suit to fall-back technically on non-reception of notice under Sec. 66 Evidence Act, in the teeth of the ‘best evidence rule’. </p>
<p>It is the duty of the party to lead the best evidence in his possession even though onus of proof do not lie on him, and he is not called upon to produce the said evidence; and the Court will draw adverse inference under Section 114(g) of the Evidence Act if such evidence is withheld.</p>
<p>But this rule cannot be applied blindly. Mere non-production of documents would not result in adverse inference, invariably (as shown below). Courts take into consideration the pleadings and decide whether the document/evidence withheld has any relevance. The court also cannot lose sight of the fact that burden of proof is on the party which makes a factual averment. The conduct and diligence of the other party is also important. Existence of some other circumstances may justify non-production (Union of India v. Ibrahim Uddin, (2012) 8 SCC 148).</p>
<p>The rule that best available evidence must be produced is taken in the following cases:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Murugesam Pillai v. Gnana Sambandha Pandara Sannadhi, AIR 1917 PC 6; </li>
<li>Hiralal v. Badkulal, AIR 1953 SC 225; </li>
<li>A. Raghavamma v. A. Chenchamma, AIR 1964 SC 136; </li>
<li>The Union of India v. Mahadeolal Prabhu Dayal, AIR 1965 SC 1755; </li>
<li><strong>Gopal Krishnaji Ketkar v. Mohamed Haji Latif, AIR 1968 SC 1413;</strong></li>
<li>M/s. Bharat Heavy Electrical Ltd. v. State of U.P.,  AIR 2003 SC 3024;</li>
<li>Khatri Hotels Pvt. Ltd. v. Union of India, (2011) 9 SCC 126.</li>
</ul>
<p>In Mohan Lal Shamlal Soni v. Union of India, AIR 1991 SC 1346, the Supreme Court held as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“It is a cardinal rule in the law of evidence that the best available evidence should be brought before the Court to prove a fact or the points in issue. But it is left either for the prosecution or for the defence to establish its respective case by adducing the best available evidence and the Court is not empowered under the provisions of the Code to compel either the prosecution or the defence to examine any particular witness or witnesses on their sides. Nonetheless if either of the parties withholds any evidence which could be produced and which, if produced, be unfavorable to the party withholding such evidence, the court can draw a presumption under illustration (g) to Section 114 of the Evidence Act.”</li>
</ul>
<p>Invoking best evidence rule it is observed by the Supreme Court in <strong>Musauddin Ahmed v. State of Assam</strong>, (2009) 14 SCC 541, as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“13. It is the duty of the party to lead the best evidence in its possession which could throw light on the issue in controversy and in case such a material evidence is withheld, the Court may draw adverse inference under Section 114 illustration (g) of the Evidence Act notwithstanding that the onus of proof did not lie on such party and it was not called upon to produce the said evidence (vide <strong>Gopal Krishnaji Ketkar v. Mohamed Haji Latif</strong>, AIR 1968 SC 1413).”</li>
</ul>
<p>In <strong>Jitendra v. State of M.P,</strong> (2004) 10 SCC 562, our Apex Court observed that charas and ganja seized from the accused was the best evidence in that case and the non-production of the same in court was seriously taken note of by the court and observed that that mere oral evidence as to the same was insufficient.(See also: <strong>Mohd. Aman, Babu Khan v. State of Rajasthan</strong>, AIR 1997 SC 2960.)</p>
<p>In <strong>Tomaso Bruno v. State of U.P</strong>, (2015) 7 SCC 178, it is observed as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“22. To invoke Section 106 of the Evidence Act, the main point to be established by the prosecution is that the accused persons were present in the hotel room at the relevant time. PW-1 Ram Singh-Hotel Manager stated that CCTV cameras are installed in the boundaries, near the reception, in the kitchen, in the restaurant and all three floors. Since CCTV cameras were installed in the prominent places, CCTV footage would have been best evidence to prove whether the accused remained inside the room and whether or not they have gone out. CCTV footage is a strong piece of evidence which would have indicated whether the accused remained inside the hotel and whether they were responsible for the commission of a crime. It would have also shown whether or not the accused had gone out of the hotel. CCTV footage being a crucial piece of evidence, it is for the prosecution to have produced the best evidence which is missing. Omission to produce CCTV footage, in our view, which is the best evidence, raises serious doubts about the prosecution case.”</li>
</ul>
<p>With regard to adverse presumption the Apex Court held in Tomaso Bruno as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“28. As per Section 114 (g) of the Evidence Act, if a party in possession of best evidence which will throw light in controversy withholds it, the court can draw an adverse inference against him notwithstanding that the onus of proving does not lie on him. The presumption under Section 114 (g) of the Evidence Act is only a permissible inference and not a necessary inference. Unlike presumption under Section 139 of Negotiable Instruments Act, where the court has no option but to draw statutory presumption under Section 114 of the Evidence Act.”</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration:underline">Directing Production Without Discovery “NOT the Correct Approach</span></strong>“</p>
<p>The indisputable reciprocity between ‘discovery’ and ‘production’, and the sequence in which the they are arrayed in Rule 12 and 14, ensure that compliance of Rule 12 is a necessary pre-condition for ordering ‘production’ under Rule 14. Therefore, it is definite that discovery under Rule 12 partakes its ‘production’ (as the next step, under Rule 14).</p>
<p>The afore-stated propositions are fortified by the following:</p>
<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li>Ordering production, under Rule 14, is purely a discretionary matter with court.
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Rule 14 reads – ” It shall be lawful for the court” … to order the production … of such of the documents in his possession or power … ”.</li>
<li>Import of these words are obvious in itself. That is, wide-open discretion is given to the court for ordering production under rule 14.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>It is unquestionable that a party to the suit has no vested right to seek ‘production’ of any document under rule 14-
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong><mark>even after ‘discovery’ of the same under rule 12</mark></strong>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Similarly, the party to the suit has no vested right to seek production of ‘all documents‘ discovered under Rule 12<strong>.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p> Of course, no doubt, the court has discretion to summon a party to produce documents under O.16 R.14 which reads as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>O. 16 R. 14: “</strong><span style="text-decoration:underline"><strong>Court may of its own accord summon as witnesses strangers to suit</strong>: Subject to the provisions of this Code</span> as to attendance and appearance <span style="text-decoration:underline">and to any law</span> for the time being in force, where the Court at any time thinks it necessary [to examine any person, including a party to the suit], and not called as a witness by a party to the suit, <span style="text-decoration:underline">the Court may</span>, of its own motion, <span style="text-decoration:underline">cause</span> such person to be summoned as a witness to give evidence, or <span style="text-decoration:underline">to produce any document in his possession</span> on a day to be appointed, and may examine him as a witness or require him to produce such document.”</li>
</ul>
<p>But, the words “of its own accord”, “subject to the provisions of this Code … and to any law” and “the Court may” make it clear that this provision is not intended to use openhandedly.</p>

</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>It will be interesting to consider whether the court has jurisdiction to <span style="text-decoration:underline"><mark class="has-inline-color has-foreground-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">compel a party to produce his title-deeds</mark></span> to any property applying the converse analogy on the negative assertion in Section 130 (otherwise than ‘discovery’ under Rule 12).</p>
<p>The answer is – No.</p>
<p>In Dolagovinda Pradhan Vs. Bhartruhari Mahatab, 1993 CIVCC 394, 1993-3 LJR 506, 1991-2 Ori LR395, 1991-3 CurCC 519, it is observed (obiter) that under Order 11, Rule 14, CPC, it would be lawful for the Court to require, the party to the suit, to produce  such documents in his possession relating to any matter in question in the suit subject to its lawful objections.  The High Court pointed out the converse analogy on the negative assertion in Section 130 Evidence Act (which provides that <span style="text-decoration:underline">no witness who i<mark class="has-inline-color has-foreground-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">s not a party</mark></span><mark class="has-inline-color has-foreground-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"> to a suit shall be compelled to produce his title-deeds to </mark>any property). Though the High Court merely referred to “lawful” authority of the court to require production of the document from a party, it clear that the postulation laid down is that the court has the “power” to order production, because the court placed the proposition in converse to the direction in Sec. 130 of the Evidence Act. It does not appear to be a correct proposition in the light of <strong>ML Sethi v. RP Kapur </strong>(supra).</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration:underline">Courts to Admit </span><u>Documents Without Proof</u></strong></p>
<p>Sections 162, 163 and 164 of the Evidence Act, reads as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>162. <strong><span style="text-decoration:underline">Production of documents</span></strong>. –– <span style="text-decoration:underline">A witness summoned to produce a document shall,</span> if it is in his possession or power, <span style="text-decoration:underline">bring it to Court,</span> notwithstanding any objection which there may be to its production or to its admissibility.

<li>The Court, if it sees fit, may inspect the document, unless it refers to matters of State, or take other evidence to enable it to determine on its admissibility.</li>
<li>163. <span style="text-decoration:underline"><strong>Giving, as evidence, of document called for and produced on notice</strong></span>: When a party calls for a document which he has given the other party notice to produce, and such<span style="text-decoration:underline"> document is produced and inspected by the party</span> calling for its production, <span style="text-decoration:underline">he is bound to give it as evidence</span> if the party producing it requires him to do so.</li>
<li>164. <strong><span style="text-decoration:underline">Using, as evidence, of document production of which was refused on notice</span>. </strong>–– When a party refuses to produce a document which he has had notice to produce, he cannot afterwards use the document as evidence <span style="text-decoration:underline">without the consent of the other party</span> or the order of the Court.</li>
</ul>
<p>In Government of Bengal v. Santiram Mondal, AIR 1930 Cal 370, and R v. Makhan, AIR 1940 Cal 167 it was observed that Section 163 of the Evidence Act applies to Criminal Proceedings also.  It is observed in Government of Bengal v. Santiram Mondal, AIR 1930 Cal 370, with respect to a document used under Sec. 163, as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“The further contention is that if they are to be admitted, they cannot be put in or at any rate used without proof. But the section itself says that the party calling for it is bound to give it as evidence if required to do so, and that certainly means that it goes in as a record of the particular proceeding and that it can be looked at to see what it includes or omits.”</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><u>Court’s Jurisdiction to Require to Prove an Admitted Document</u></strong></p>
<p>In any case, besides the powers of the court under Sec. 165 of Evidence Act, the scheme of the Procedural Acts (Evidence Act, CPC and CrPC) shows that the court has jurisdiction to require the party concerned to prove that document. We can see it in Sec. 58 of Evidence Act, Order XII, Rule 2A Proviso of the CPC and Sec. 294 of the CrPC .</p>
<p>Section 294 of Code of Criminal Procedure reads as follows:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“294. <span style="text-decoration:underline">No formal proof of certain documents</span>. (1) Where any document is filed before any Court by the prosecution or the accused, the particulars of every such document shall be included in a list and the prosecution or the accused, as the case may be, or the pleader for the prosecution or the accused, if any, shall be called upon to admit or deny the genuineness of each such document.</li>
<li>(2) The list of documents shall be in such form as may be prescribed by the State Government.</li>
<li>(3) Where the genuineness of any document is not disputed, such document may be read in evidence in any inquiry, trial or other proceeding under this Code without proof of the signature of the person to whom it purports to be signed:</li>
<li>Provided that the Court may, in its discretion, require such signature to be proved.”</li>
