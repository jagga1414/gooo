<p>In Vareed Jacob v. Sosamma Geevarghese, (2004) 6 SCC 378, the majority found that on <span style="text-decoration: underline">restoration of the suit</span> dismissed for default <span style="text-decoration: underline">all interlocutory matters shall stand restored</span>, <span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong><mark class="has-inline-color has-primary-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">unless</mark></strong> the <span style="text-decoration: underline">order of dismissal to show to the contrary</span>, and unless the order of restoration says otherwise</span>. The Apex Court considered the following decisions:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>.(i) Saranatha Ayyangar v. Muthiah Moopanar, AIR 1934 Mad 49</li>
<li>(ii) Bankim Chandra v. Chandi Prasad reported in AIR 1956 Pat 271. </li>
<li>(iii) Shivaraya v. Sharnappa reported in AIR 1968 Mysore 283. </li>
<li>(iv) <u>Abdul Hamid v. Karim Bux, AIR 1973 All 67</u>. </li>
<li>(v) Nandipati Rami Reddi v. Nandipati Padma Reddy, AIR 1978 AP 30. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong><u>Dismissal of the Suit in Default, Attachment before Judgment Automatically Ceases</u></strong></p>
<p>It is pointed out in Vareed Jacob v. Sosamma Geevarghese –</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong><mark class="has-inline-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#cf2e2e">Order 38, Rule 9 directs that the Court shall order withdrawal of attachment when the suit is dismissed. </mark></strong></li>
<li><mark class="has-inline-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#700ad0">Therefore, Rule 9 makes it mandatory for the Court to lift the attachment at the time of the dismissal of the suit. </mark></li>
<li><strong><mark class="has-inline-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#cf2e2e">Such a provision is not there under Order 39 or under Order 40.</mark></strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong><u>It is Mandatory to Lift the Attachment on Dismissal of the Suit</u></strong></p>
<p>In Vareed Jacob v. Sosamma Geevarghese, (2004) 6 SCC 378, the majority relied on the following decisions also:</p>
<p>(i) <strong><u>Raj Chandra Gupta v. Ramesh Kishore reported in AIR 1965 All 546</u></strong>. Relying on Ram Chand v. Pitam Mal, (1888) ILR 10 All. 506, it was held that on the dismissal of the suit either on merit or for default <strong>a<span style="text-decoration: underline">ttachment</span></strong><span style="text-decoration: underline"> before judgment <strong>shall cease </strong>and it shall not revive automatically</span> on restoration of the suit.</p>
<p>(ii) <strong>Nancy John Lyndon v. Prabhati Lal Chowdhury reported in 1987 (4) SCC 78</strong>, it has been held that in view of Order 21, Rule 57, C. P. C. it is clear that with the dismissal of the title execution suit for default, <span style="text-decoration: underline">the <strong>attachment</strong> levied earlier<strong> ceased</strong></span>. However, it has been further held that when the dismissal was set aside and the suit was restored, the effect of restoring the suit was to <span style="text-decoration: underline">restore the position prevalent till the dismissal of the suit or before dismissal of the title execution suit</span>. It was further pointed out that the scheme under Order 21, Rule 57 was similar to Order 38, Rule 11 and Rule 11-A, C P C and therefore, it cannot be applied to all interlocutory orders on the same basis.</p>
