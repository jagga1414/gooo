<p>Rule 99 of Order XXI of the CPC says that where any person other than the judgment debtor is dispossessed, he can make an application complaining of such dispossession.</p>
<p>Rule 101 directs that all questions (including questions relating to right, title or interest in the property) arising on the applications under Rule 99 shall be determined by the Court dealing with the application, and not by a separate suit.</p>
<p>Rule 102 bars placing such obstruction by pendente lite transferees. </p>
<p style="line-height:1.4"><strong><u>Usha Sinha v. Dina Ram is the Classic decision</u></strong>.<span style="text-decoration: underline"> Held – </span><strong><u>If pendente lite transferee could resist, Every time he will transfer the property</u></strong></p>
<p>Usha Sinha V. Dina Ram and others (2008) 7 SCC 144, is the classic decision on this subject. It is pointed out that if pendente lite transferee could resist or obstruct execution of a decree, every time the decree holder seeks execution, the judgment debtor will transfer the property. It is laid down in this decision-</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Rule 102 declares that if the resistance is caused or obstruction is offered by a transferee pendente lite of the judgment debtor, he cannot seek benefit of Rule 98 or 100 of Order XXI.</li>
<li>If unfair, inequitable or undeserved protection is afforded to a transferee pendente lite, a decree holder will never be able to realize the fruits of his decree.</li>
<li>Every time the decree holder seeks a direction from a Court to execute the decree, the judgment debtor or his transferee will transfer the property and the new transferee will offer resistance or cause obstruction. To avoid such a situation, the rule has been enacted.</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline">Rule 102, therefore, clarifies that </span>there <span style="text-decoration: underline">should not be resistance or obstruction by a transferee pendente lite.</span></li>
<li>Since the appellant is a purchaser pendente lite and as she has no right to offer resistance or cause obstruction and as her rights have not been crystallized in a decree, Rule 102 of Order 21 of the Code comes into operation. Hence, she cannot resist execution during the pendency of the suit instituted by her.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><u>Scope of adjudication is confined to whether transfer was pendent lite</u></strong></p>
<p>It is pointed out in Usha Sinha V. Dina Ram that it was held in <strong>Silverline Forum Pvt. Ltd. v. Rajiv Trust, (1998) 3 SCC 723</strong>, that where there is a the transfer pendente lite, the scope of adjudication is confined to a question whether he was a transferee during the pendency of a suit in which the decree was passed. Once the finding is in the affirmative, the Executing Court must hold that he had no right to resist or obstruct and such person cannot seek protection from the Executing Court.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Whether ‘Pendente Lite Transfer’ – if  it was After Dismissal of Suit, for </strong></span><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">D</span></strong><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>efault</strong></span></p>
<p>In <strong>Jini Dhanraj Gir v. Shibu Mathew (SC, 16 May, 2023)</strong>, one of the questions arisen was whether there was ‘pendente lite transfer’, if the transfer was made after dismissal (post-dismissal) of the suit for default (and before its restoration). It was argued that during the time when the transfer was effected there was no pending lis. The Executing Court posted the EP to determine the question as to whether the transfer would attract Rule 102. </p>
<p>The Apex Court observed that the claim raised by the Respondents, ‘<em>cannot be thrown out at the threshold since it is well within their rights to contest the application under Order XXI Rule 97, CPC</em>‘. The Apex Court directed that it was most appropriate for the Executing Court to determine the question as to whether the transfer would attract Rule 102.</p>
