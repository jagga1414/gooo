<p><strong><u>Analysis of S. 3(1)(viii)</u></strong> <strong><u>Proviso</u></strong></p>
<p>Proviso speaks about “agricultural lands interspersed within the plantation”. In Poddar Plantations Limited v.  Thekkemariveettil Madhavi Amma, 2014-1 ILR(Ker) 813; 2013-4 KLJ 781; 2014-1 KLT 439, it is held: </p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“Section 2(44) (c) cannot be read in isolation of Sec. 3(1)(viii) of the KLR Act. Reading the two provisions together, what can be discerned is only that if the tenant is entitled to fixity over the plantation (not being in excess of 30 acres), then, the <span style="text-decoration:underline">land referred to in <strong>Sec. 2 (44)(c) </strong>of the KLR Act should <strong>also be counted </strong>and the <strong>tenant shall not be evicted</strong> from that land <strong><mark class="has-inline-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#0920f3">though he is not entitled to fixity</mark></strong> over such land</span>. This view is supported by the decisions in State of Kerala v. Amalgamated Tea Estates Co. (1980 KLT 728) and State of Kerala v. Hope Plantations Ltd. (1985 KLT SN 4 (Case No.6). If such an interpretation is not given, the result will be anomalous in that even if a person is liable to be evicted from the plantation, he can cling on to the land referred to in Sec.2(44)(c) of the KLR Act though not entitled to fixity. The <span style="text-decoration:underline">intention of the Legislature was only to avoid eviction of the tenant from the land coming under Sec.2(44)(c) </span>which is <span style="text-decoration:underline">necessary for the proper management of area of plantation</span> over which he is entitled to fixity.”</li>

<p><strong><u>Effect of Conversion of A Portion of Exempted Land</u></strong> <strong><u>into a Non-exempted Category</u></strong></p>
<p>Section 87 reads as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“S.87. Excess land obtained by gift, etc. to be surrendered – (1) Where any person acquires any land dafter the date notified under Section 83 by gift, purchase, mortgage with possession, lease, surrender or any other kind of transfer inter vivos or by bequest or inheritance or otherwise and in consequence thereof the total extent of land owned or held by such person exceeds the ceiling area, such excess shall be surrendered to such authority as may be prescribed.</li>
<li>       Explanation 1 – Where any land is exempted by or under Section 81 and such exemption is in force on the date notified under Section 83, such land shall, with effect from the date on which it ceases to be exempted, be deemed to be land acquired after the date notified under Section 83.</li>
<li>       Explanation II – Where, after the date notified under Section 83, any class of land specified in Schedule II has been <strong><u>converted into any other class of land</u></strong> specified in that Schedule or any land exempt under Section 81 from the provisions of this Chapter is converted into any class of land not so exempt and in consequence thereof the total extent of land owned or held by a person exceeds the ceiling area, so much extent of land as is in excess of the ceiling area, shall be deemed to be land acquired after the said date.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><u>No Total Prohibition in using Exempted Land for a Different Purpose</u></strong></p>
<p>Explanation II does not make a total bar. It only causes to lose benefit of the exemption to a certain extent. That is, if a person converts any portion of his exempted land to any other class, that converted extent will be added to his account in determining his ceiling limit; and the Taluk Land Board can proceed upon that (excess) land. In short, the exemption will be lost for that portion. In this premises, in Wayanad Granites v. District Collector, 2023-4 KLT 874, it is held that ‘fragmentation is per se not illegal’. similarly, in District Collector v. Sajith Lal, 2023-4 KLJ 851, it is held that ‘there is no embargo under law in using any exempted land for non-exempted purposes as well’.</p>
<p>In <strong>Mathew K.T v. State of Kerala, 19 April, 2024</strong>, in the light of earlier decisions, observed that there is no total prohibition in using an exempted land for a different purpose under the Kerala Land Reforms Act. The impediment or restriction is (only) the following –</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>If a portion of the exempted land is utilised for any other purpose, that would fall within his ceiling area and the authorities may be able to initiate ceiling proceedings.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Full Bench decision, Mathew K. Jacob v. District Environmental Impact Assessment Authority [AIR 2019 Ker. 67, affirmed by the Supreme Court in K.H. Nazar v. Mathew K. Jacob, 2020-14 SCC 126] held as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“We however add that any class of land earlier exempted in the ceiling case can be converted into any class of land not liable to be exempted under Explanation II to Section 87 of the Act. The consequence is that the benefit of the exemption would be lost and the extent added to the account of the assessee or the declarant in determination of his ceiling area. That is a matter to be dealt with by the Taluk Land Board with the assessee or the declarant and other interested parties on the party array and we desist from elaborating further.”</li>
</ul>
<p>In District Collector v. Sajith Lal (2023-4 KLJ 851; 2023 KLT OnLine 1225) it is held as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“5. There is no embargo under law in using any exempted land for non- exempted purposes as well. If the land is used for non-exempted purposes, the holder of the land will lose the qualification for exemption, thus giving authority to the Land Board to initiate ceiling proceedings.” (Quoted in: Mathew K.T v. State of Kerala, 19 April, 2024)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><u>No Embargo to Transfer Plantation Land</u></strong></p>
<p>In R. V.  Devassia v. Sub Registrar, Idukki, 2015-1 ILR(Ker) 1047; 2015-1 KHC 805; 2015-2 KLJ 17, it is held as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“9. On promulgation of the KLR Act in the State, the entire landed property in the State is subjected to State control as envisaged under the provisions of the KLR Act. No piece of the land escapes the clutches of the KLR Act including exempted land for ceiling purposes. The ceiling proceedings is a continuing proceedings and can be reopened in any of the circumstances, if so warranted, as contemplated under Section 87 of the KLR Act. Exemption granted from ceiling is the qualification to use the land in a particular manner, which means a burden is imposed on the land. The moment the qualification for exemption is vanished by conversion of the land, the protection from ceiling will also be extinguished to bring the land within the fold of the ceiling area. The exemption is in the nature of a burden on the land to use the land for the purpose for which exemption is granted. The eminent domain power of the State can be exercised for acquiring land without consent and also to regulate the use of land in public interest. The eminent domain is power inherent in any Sovereign State. This burden would bind the holder of the land as on 01/01/1970 and the successor-in-interest. The Division Bench of this Court in the State Human Rights Protection Centre, Thrissur and another v. State of Kerala and others [2009 (3) ILR 695] held that exemption granted under S.81(1)(a) is for the land and would continue to operate irrespective of <strong><u><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong><mark class="has-inline-color has-primary-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">change of ownership</mark></strong></span> </u></strong>of the exempted land and the <strong>transferee </strong>would have <strong>to use the land for the purpose for which exemption</strong> is granted.”</li>
</ul>
<p>In Everest Stone Crusher and Granites v. District Collector, Kannur, 2020-6 KHC 289, it is observed as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“16. In Devassia R.V. this Court noticed that, the provisions of the Kerala Land Reforms Act do not place any embargo on transfer. The transfer of registry is for fiscal purposes. The power of the competent authority to reopen the ceiling proceedings to include the land exempted for the purpose of ceiling is not lost on account of effecting mutation. Therefore, the Revenue Officials cannot refuse to effect mutation of the property purchased by the transferee.”</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="text-decoration:underline"><strong>Effect of Fragmentation for</strong></span><strong><span style="text-decoration:underline"> Non-exempted Category</span></strong></p>
<p>The decision in One Earth One Life v. State of Kerala, 2019-2 KHC(SN) 10; 2019-1 KLT 985, arose from the Writ Petition filed for a declaration that the fragmentation and <span style="text-decoration: underline"><mark class="has-inline-color has-primary-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><strong>sale </strong>of a Rubber Plantation</mark> </span>for non-plantation purposes was illegal as it defeated the purpose of the Kerala Land Reforms Act. When the matter was placed before the Taluk Land Board under Sec 87, KLR Act, it found that there was no change in classification of the land and therefore dropped the proceedings. The Court held as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“34. Section 81 of the KLR Act is in pith and substance a special provision, with its <span style="text-decoration:underline">main objective of giving exemption</span> to certain lands including the lands maintained as plantations is to <span style="text-decoration:underline">prevent fragmentation</span> of the land and to keep it as plantation itself <span style="text-decoration:underline">to improve the economy of the state</span> for welfare of people as a whole while the Act creates a regime, the State is under an obligation to safeguard, the intended purpose of the provisions of the Act in its spirit. ….. …… I<span style="text-decoration:underline">t could be gathered from the records that</span> t<span style="text-decoration:underline">he proposal to transfer</span> 1.03 acres of land to each workers in discharge of their service or retrenchment benefits <span style="text-decoration:underline">will definitely divide the plantation into separate slots</span> and that would <span style="text-decoration:underline">definitely change the character/nature of the plantation, which could be termed as ‘conversion’</span> and that will be against the provisions of the Act.”</li>

<p>Possession is a heritable and transferable right. [See: Nallammal v. Ayisha Beevi, 2017-5 Mad LJ 864; Phirayalal Kapur Vs. Jia Rani, AIR 1973 Delhi 186].

<li>However, insofar as the cultivating tenant is concerned, an absolute right is vested with him to seek assignment (within ceiling limit) subject to the payment of purchase price – as stated in Section 72D. (See: Glen Leven Estate (P) Ltd. v. State of Kerala, 2022-6 Ker LT 439.)</li>

<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Valia Raja v. Veeraraghava Iyer, 1961 Ker LT 103, it was held that the question of apportionment of compensation has to depend upon the rights of the parties on the date of the acquisition. Referrd to in: Varkey Thomas Vs. Annamma Abraham,  1969 Ker LT 903.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><u>Glen Leven Estate (P) Ltd. v. State of Kerala, 2022-6 Ker LT 439</u></strong></p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>In Glen Leven Estate (P) Ltd. v. State of Kerala, 2022-6 Ker LT 439, the question as to ‘rival claims raised by the <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">cultivating tenant</span></strong> and landlord for compensation on acquisition’ arose. The land was leased out by landlords. The lease-rights came in the cultivating tenants by transfer. The Government contended that the tenant was a cultivating tenant and the land vested upon the Govt. under Sec. 72 KLR Act. Hence tenant alone would be entitled to get compensation for the improvements to be determined under the Kerala Compensation for Tenants Improvements Act, 1958, in view of Section 20(1) of the KLR Act.</li>
<li>The landlords argued that the land was a plantation (over 30 acres) when it was (originally) leased, and therefore, they are entitled to claim exemption and benefits in the light of the exemption under clause (viii)  of Section 3 (1) of the KLR Act. Since there would be no fixity of tenure, it being a plantation, there would not be vesting of rights of the land owner in the Government. Hence, there should be the apportionment of the compensation between the lessor and the lessee and it should be decided in the acquisition proceedings.</li>
<li>The single Judge dismissed the writ petition, ‘leaving open the liberty of the lessee as well as the landlords, to approach the civil court seeking relief against the Government, and also to resolve the inter se dispute by and between the tenant and the landlords’.</li>
<li>The Division Bench, in appeal held that ‘land acquisition’ proceedings are to be initiated. It is pointed out that (even if it is a land vested in Govt.) there is no provision in Sec. 72 for ‘resuming’ if and when Govt. need it. The court also observed as under –
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“31. On an analysis of the provisions of Section 72(1) of the Act, 1963, it is clear that when the Government notified the said provision with effect from 01.01.1970, all right, title and interest of the landowners and intermediaries in respect of holdings held by cultivating tenants (including holders of kudiyirippus and holders karaimas) entitled to fixity of tenure under Section 13, and in respect of which certificates of purchase under sub-Section (2) of Section 59 have not been issued, vested in the Government.</li>
<li>32. Therefore, it is clear from Section 72 that what is vested with the Government is the right, title and interest of the land owners and intermediaries in respect of the holdings held by the cultivating tenants. It is nothing but a legal fiction by which the interest held by a cultivating tenant in a property of a landlord or intermediary is protected from 01.01.1970 .</li>
<li>34. On a conjoint reading of Sections 72 and 72A, it can be seen that vesting of rights in the Government contained under Section 72 is the rights held by the landlord and the intermediary in respect of holdings held by the cultivating tenants. However, the same will not, in any manner, interfere with the rights enjoyed by a cultivating tenant in contemplation of the provisions of the Act, 1963.”</li>
<li>42. Therefore, we have no doubt in our mind to hold that Section 72 of Act, 1963 would only deal with the right, title and interest of the land owners and intermediaries in respect of the holdings held by the cultivating tenants free from encumbrances created by the land owners and intermediaries. However, the legal provisions discussed above would make it clear that insofar as the cultivating tenant is concerned, an absolute right is vested with him to seek assignment subject to the payment of purchase price in contemplation of Section 72D of the Act, 1963.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>While considering the right of landlord, it is pointed out (basing on the principle, or scheme of the KLR Act<strong><mark class="has-inline-color has-primary-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">*<sup>*</sup></mark></strong>) that the landlord may have right for compensation under Section 72BB. The Division Bench said-<ul><li>“36. So also, sub-Section (1) of Section 72BB dealing with ‘the right of landlord to apply for assignment and compensation’ specifies that any landowner or intermediary, whose right, title and interest in respect of any holding have vested in the Government, may apply to the Land Tribunal for the assignment of such right, title and interest to the cultivating tenant and for the payment of the compensation due to him under Section 72A.”</li></ul></li>

The State  contended that there was gross violation of the land laws and FERA. The State also asserted a fraud on the Constitution of India, warranting immediate action in public interest and based on public policy as enjoined under Article 296 of the Constitution. </li>

<p>Sec. 72B reads as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">

<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">Is Purchase Certificate (<strong><em><mark class="has-inline-color has-primary-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">inaccurate on its face, for excess of the ceiling area</mark></em></strong>) Conclusive Proof?</span></strong></p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>No.</li>
</ul>
<p>Our Apex Court considered this matter in <strong><u>Chettian Veetil Ammad v. Taluk Land Board</u></strong>, <strong><u>AIR</u></strong> <strong><u>1979   SC  1573; 1980 1 SCC 499</u></strong> (P.N. Shinghal &amp; O. Chinnappa Reddy, JJ.) where Purchase Certificate was issued, excess of the ceiling area, as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“27. It would thus appear that even though the <strong><u>certificate of purchase issued under sub-section (1) of Section 72-K is conclusive proof</u></strong> of the assignment of the right, title and interest of the landowner in favour of the holder in respect of the holding concerned under sub-section (2), that only means that no contrary evidence shall be effective to displace it, <strong><em>unless the so called conclusive proof is <mark class="has-inline-color has-primary-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">inaccurate on its face, or fraud can be shown</mark> (Halsburys – Laws of England, fourth edition, Vol. 17, page 22 paragraph 28)</em></strong>, It may be stated that “inaccuracy on the face” of the certificate is not as wide in its connotation as an “error apparent on the face of the record.” It will not therefore be permissible for the Board to disregard the evidentiary value of the certificate of purchase merely on the ground that it has not been issued on a proper appreciation or consideration of the evidence on record, or that the. Tribunals finding suffers from any <strong><u>procedural error</u></strong>. What sub-section (2) of Section <strong><u>72-K provides is an irrebuttable presumption of law,</u></strong> and it may will be regarded as a rule of substantive law. But even so, for reasons already stated, it does not thereby take away the jurisdiction of the Taluk Land Board to make an order under Section 85 (5) after taking into consideration the “conclusive” evidentiary value of the certificate of purchase according to Section 72-K (2) as far as it goes.”</li>
</ul>
<p>It is also noteworthy (as stated above) that a <span style="text-decoration: underline">purchase certificate shall not bind one, who was not party</span> to the proceedings before the Land Tribunal, having better title over the property covered by the purchase certificate (Thayukutty v. Manikandan, the Kerala High Court (2023).</p>
