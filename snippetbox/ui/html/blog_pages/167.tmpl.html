<p>The RTI Act, though allows certified copy, it does not <strong><mark class="has-inline-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#101bf3">permit</mark></strong> the same “<span style="text-decoration:underline"><mark class="has-inline-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#2c0ef0"><strong>to be given in evidence</strong></mark></span>“. Therefore, the ‘certified copy’ obtained under the RTI Act  can be received in evidence either <strong>(i)</strong> it is a <span style="text-decoration: underline">public document</span> (of which a certified copy is permitted by the Evidence Act) or  <strong>(ii) </strong>it is permitted to be produced on <span style="text-decoration: underline">showing reason for non production of original</span> etc. (under Sec. 65 Evidence Act).</p>
<p>In Narayan Singh v. Kallaram, AIR 2015 MP 186, it was observed that RTI documents can be admitted as secondary evidence. The MP High Court held as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“Clause (f) of Section 65 of Evidence Act makes it crystal clear that a certified copy permitted under the Evidence Act or by any other law in force can be treated as secondary evidence. Right to Information Act, in my view, falls within the ambit of “by any other law in force in India”. The definition of “right to information” makes it clear that certified copies of documents are given to the citizens under their right to obtain information. In my view, the court below has rightly opined that the documents can be admitted as secondary evidence. I do not see any merit in the contention that the documents obtained under the Act of 2005 are either true copies or attested copies. The definition aforesaid shows that the same are certified copies.”</li>
</ul>
<p>It appears that the High Court did not give effect to the words “<strong>permitted … to be given in evidence</strong>”.</p>
<p><strong><u>PRESUMPTION</u></strong> <strong><span style="text-decoration:underline">under Sec. 114, Evid. Act read with Sec. 35</span>.</strong></p>
<p>Sec. 35 Evd. Act lays down that ‘an <span style="text-decoration:underline">entry in</span> any <span style="text-decoration: underline">public or other official book, register or record or an electronic record</span>‘ will be a relevant fact. </p>
<p>Sec. 35 of the Evidence Act reads as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“35.<span style="text-decoration:underline"> Relevancy of entry in public record or an electronic record made in performance of duty</span>: An entry in any public or other official book, register or record or an electronic record, stating a fact in issue or relevant fact, and made by a public servant in the discharge of his official duty, or by any other person in performance of a duty specially enjoined by the law of the country in which such book, register, or record or an electronic record is kept, is itself a relevant fact.
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Note: Relevancy engrafted to Sec. 35 Evd. Act is “<span style="text-decoration: underline">entry</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline">in</span>” any public or official book, register etc.; it is not attached to the certificates or information given under the RTI Act.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Besides direct evidence, or admission, the contents of a document can also be proved by circumstantial evidence or by invoking presumption. ‘Common course of natural events’, ‘human conduct’ etc. under S. 114, can be used to prove the existence and genuineness/truth of a document.</p>
<p>Illustration (e) of Sec. 114, Evd. Act, demonstrates that presumption as to ‘regularity’ can be invoked on Judicial and official acts, in proper cases.  ‘Regularity’ in Illustration (e) is not exactly the <span style="text-decoration:underline">presumption as to ‘correctness or truth’.</span> For such presumption, we have to resort the main section, Sec. 114 – that is, ‘common course of natural events’, ‘human conduct’, etc..</p>
<p>Referring relevant provisions of Himachal Land Revenue Act, 1954 and Sec. 35 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872, it is held by our Apex Court in <strong>Partap Singh v. Shiv Ram</strong>: AIR 2020 SC 1382, that Record-of-rights (Revenue document) carries the <span style="text-decoration:underline">‘presumption of <strong>correctness</strong>‘</span>.</p>
<p>In Inder Singh v. S. Raghbir Singh, AIR 1978 P&amp;H 98, it is observed as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“The principle is that an official record, kept by a person, upon whom there is a public duty to make entries in it only after satisfying himself of the truth of those entries, is presumed to be correct. Such a document itself is <span style="text-decoration:underline">evidence of the <strong>truth</strong> of its contents</span> unless and until its falsity can be demonstrated by any of the various methods by which the evidentiary value of any public book, register or document may be attacked.”</li>
</ul>
<p>In Shiv Ram v. Shiv Charan Singh, AIR 1964 Raj 126, it is observed as under</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“Where Sec. 35  properly comes into play, an <span style="text-decoration: underline">entry</span> made by a public servant <span style="text-decoration: underline">in</span> any public or official book in the discharge of his official duty becomes relevant by itself, and <span style="text-decoration:underline">no other proof of such entry is required</span> as a matter of law by our Evidence Act, but this, does not exclude the possibility that such an entry may become admissible otherwise if it is properly proved to have been made by a person ordinarily competent to make it.” (Quoted in Mayadhar Nayak vs Sub-Divisional Officer, Jajpur, AIR 1982 Ori 221).</li>
</ul>
<p>Read Blog: <a href="https://indianlawlive.net/2021/07/18/presumptions-on-documents/"><strong>Presumptions on Documents and Truth of its Contents</strong></a></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">RTI Replies are </span><span style="text-decoration:underline">not a Substantive Evidence</span></strong></p>
<p>As shown above, relevancy attached to Sec. 35 Evidence Act is “<span style="text-decoration: underline">entry</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline">in</span>” any public or official book made by a public servant in the discharge of his official duty; it is not engrafted to the certificates or information given under the RTI Act.</p>
<p>The usual method to prove documents (both, existence and truth of contents) is giving oral evidence or furnishing affidavit. A certificate, in most cases, is an opinion, and prepared on the basis of other documents or evidences. In such cases, when it is an assumption or inference, it by itself, is not admissible, as it will only be, at the most, a secondary evidence. A Wound Certificate is not a substantive evidence. It has to be proved by a competent witness. If presumption cannot be invoked under Clause (e) of Sec. 114 Evidence Act (that judicial and official acts have been regularly performed), especially in the light of ‘best evidence rule’, no certificate or report can be taken as proved unless its contents are proved in a formal manner. (This is why Order XXVI rule 10 CPC specifically says – Commission Report shall ‘form part of the record’.)</p>
<p>Our Apex Court held in Dharmarajan v. Valliammal, 2008 (2) SCC 741, that ‘a certificate issued by the Tahsildar cannot be relied on without examining the Tahsildar who issued the same’. It is referred to in Pankajakshan Nair v. Shylaja, ILR 2017-1 Ker 951.</p>
<p>Our Apex Court observed in State of Himachal Pradesh v. Jai Lal, (1999) 7 SCC 280, as regards expert opinion that falls under Sec. 45 Evidence Act, as under as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“An <span style="text-decoration: underline">expert is a witness of fact</span>. His evidence is really of an advisory character. The duty of an expert witness is to furnish the Judge with the necessary scientific criteria for testing the accuracy of the conclusions so as to enable the Judge to form his independent judgment by the application of this criteria to the facts proved by the evidence of the case. The scientific opinion evidence, if intelligible, convincing and tested becomes a factor and often an important factor for consideration along with the other evidence of the case. The credibility of such a witness depends on the reasons stated in support of his conclusions and the data and material furnished which form the basis of his conclusions.”</li>
</ul>

<div class="wp-block-group is-vertical is-layout-flex wp-container-core-group-is-layout-6 wp-block-group-is-layout-flex">
<p>The information collected from the records of an office by an RTI Officer, or that furnished in RTI Reply, cannot be placed in a higher pedestal than the ‘opinion’ of an expert under Sec. 45 of the Evidence Act. In short, the RTI Reply, by itself, will not be a substantive evidence.</p>

In other words, <span style="text-decoration: underline">if the official under RTI certifies and supplies a private document, it still remains a private document</span>.

<li>The Xerox copy certified by the designated Public Information Officer under Right to Information Act of the <span style="text-decoration: underline">private documents are not certified copies</span> within the meaning of the provisions of Section 65 of the Evidence Act. They are merely true copies of the private documents available in the records of the particular Department. The production and marking of such copies is permissible only after laying a foundation for acceptance of secondary evidence under clauses (a) (b) or (c) of Section 65 of the Act. The condition prescribed under the above cases (a), (b) or (c) of Section 65 of the Act have to be fulfilled before marking the true copies obtained under the Right to Information Act. <span style="text-decoration: underline">However, the t</span><span style="text-decoration:underline">rue copies of public documents certified by the designated Information Officer can be taken as certified copies of the public documents</span>.</li>
