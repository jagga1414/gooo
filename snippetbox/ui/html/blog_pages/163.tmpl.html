<p><strong><u>Modes of Proof of Documents</u></strong></p>
<p>Modes of Proof of Documents (as to, both, ‘formal proof’ and ‘truth of the contents’) include the following:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong><u>Admission</u></strong> of the person who wrote or signed the document (Sec. 17, 21, 58, 67, 70).</li>
<li>Evidence of a person in whose presence the document was signed or written – ocular evidence (Sec. 59).</li>
<li>An attesting witness (Sec. 59).</li>
<li>Opinion of a person who is acquainted with the writing of the person who signed or wrote (Sec. 47).</li>
<li><strong><u>Admission</u></strong> made by the person who signed or wrote the document made in judicial proceedings (Sec. 32, 33).</li>
<li>Evidence of a handwriting expert-opinion evidence/scientific evidence (Sec.45).</li>
<li>Evidence of a person who in routine has been receiving the document; or a document signed by such a person in the ordinary course of his business or official duty, though he may have never seen the author signing the document (Sec. 32, 34, 35 or 114).</li>
<li>Invoking (specific) presumptions under Sec. 79 to 90A.</li>
<li>Presumptions (general) under Sec. 114.</li>
<li>Circumstantial evidence: on probability or inferences (Sec. 114).</li>
<li>Court-comparison (Sec. 73).</li>
<li>Facts judicially noticeable (Sec. 56 and 57).</li>
<li>A fact of common-knowledge. (It does not require proof. See: Union Of India v. Virendra Bharti: 2011-2 ACC 886, 2010  ACJ 2353; Rakhal Chakraborty v. Sanjib Kumar Roy: 1998-1 GauLR 253, 1997-2 GauLT 705)</li>
<li>Internal evidence afforded by the contents of the document; a link in a chain of correspondence; recipient of the documen<em>t. </em>(Mobarik Ali Ahmed v. State of Bombay, AIR 1957 SC 857)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><u>Certain Facts Need Not Be Proved</u></strong></p>
<p>CHAPTER III of the Indian Evidence Act (Section 56 to 58) lays down ‘Facts Which Need Not Be Proved’. They are the following:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“56. Fact judicially noticeable need not be proved. –– No fact of which the Court will take judicial notice need be proved.</li>
<li>57. Facts of which Court must take judicial notice. –– The Court shall take judicial notice of the following facts: ––
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>(1) All laws in force in the territory of India;</li>
<li>(2) All public Acts passed or hereafter to be passed by Parliament of the United Kingdom, and all local and personal Acts directed by Parliament  of the United Kingdom to be judicially noticed;</li>
<li>(3) Articles of War for the Indian Army, Navy or Air Force;</li>

<li>(13) The rule of the road on land or at sea.In all these cases, and also on all matters of public history, literature, science or art, the Court may resort for its aid to appropriate books or documents of reference.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If the Court is called upon by any person to take judicial notice of any fact, it may refuse to do so unless and until such person produces any such book or document as it may consider necessary to enable it to do so.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><u>Truth of Contents of Document Invoking ADMISSION</u></strong></p>
<p>Truth of the contents of a document, can be established</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>(i)   by oral evidence of one who can vouchsafe the same,</li>
<li>(ii)  by invoking circumstantial evidence or ‘presumption’ or</li>
<li>(iii) by express <strong><u>admission</u></strong> by the other side.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><u>Admission</u></strong><strong><u> – Sections 17 to 21 of the Evidence Act</u></strong></p>
<p>Admission is discussed, in Sections 17 to 21 of the Evidence Act. The general and important propositions on admission are the following:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>An unambiguous and straightforward admission is the best evidence in a case.</li>
<li>An admission is not conclusive.</li>
<li>It can be explained as provided under Sec. 31 of the Evidence Act.</li>
<li>In many cases it may be conclusive; in some cases, it may shift the burden of proof.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><u>Sec. 31 of the Evidence Act – <span style="text-decoration: underline">Admissions are not conclusive proof, but may estop</span></u></strong></p>
<p>Sec. 31 of the Evidence Act lays down that admissions are not conclusive proof, but may estop. It reads as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“31. <span style="text-decoration: underline">Admissions not conclusive proof, but may estop</span> – Admissions are not conclusive proof of the matters admitted, but they may operate as estoppels under the provisions hereinafter contained.”</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><u>Facts Admitted need not be Proved</u></strong></p>
<p>Order VIII Rule 5 of the CPC lays down that a fact not specifically denied in written statement shall be taken to be admitted. This principle is contained in Section 58 of the Evidence Act also.</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“58. <span style="text-decoration: underline">Facts admitted need not be proved</span> – No fact need be proved in any proceeding which the parties thereto or their agents agree to admit at the hearing, or which, before the hearing, they agree to admit by any writing under their hands, or which by any rule of pleading in force at the time they are deemed to have admitted by their pleadings:</li>
<li>Provided that the Court may, in its discretion, require the facts admitted to be proved otherwise than by such admissions.”</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><u>Admission</u></strong><strong><u> is</u></strong><strong> <u>Substantive Evidence</u></strong></p>
<p>In Thiru John v. Returning Officer, AIR 1977 SC 1724, the Supreme Court held that it is well settled that a party’s admission is substantive evidence – proprio vigore.</p>
<p>But at the same time the Court, in its discretion, may require such fact to be proved and established.</p>
<p><strong><u>Judicial Admissions,</u></strong> <strong><u>Stand on a Higher Footing</u></strong></p>
<p>Admissions in pleadings are judicial admissions. They stand on a higher footing than evidentiary admissions.</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>They may give rise to ‘Foundation of Rights’.</li>
<li>They are fully binding on the party that makes them and constitute a waiver of proofs.</li>
<li>Evidentiary admissions are not conclusive by themselves and they can be shown to be wrong.</li>
</ul>
<p>In Nagindas Ramdas v. Dalpatram Icharam, AIR 1974 SC 471, held that admissions in pleadings are judicial admissions under Section 58 of the Evidence Act. They are made by parties or their agents at or before the hearing of a case and stand on a higher footing than evidentiary admissions. Former class of admissions are fully binding on the party that makes them and constitute a waiver of proofs. They by themselves can be made the foundation of the rights of parties. On the other hand evidentiary admissions which are receivable at the trial as evidence are by themselves not conclusive and they can be shown to be wrong.</p>
<p><strong><u>Admission of Contents of Document in Pleadings</u></strong></p>
<p>In Perumal Chettiar v. Kamakshi Ammal, AIR 1938 Mad 785; (1938) 2 MLJ 189, it is observed, as to pleadings, as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“The result, in India, is that if by reason of the document being <span style="text-decoration: underline">unstamped,</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline">no evidence of its contents </span>whether primary or secondary is admissible, evidence of admissions by the defendant is equally inadmissible. The <span style="text-decoration: underline">position may be different where admissions are made in the pleadings </span>themselves (cf. Huddleston v, Briscoe (1805) 11 Ves. 583 (596) : 32 E.R. 1215 (1220) and Thynne v. Protheroe (1814) 2 M. &amp; S. 553 : 105 E.R. 488), <span style="text-decoration: underline">because by reason of Section 58 of the Evidence Act</span>, it may not be necessary to prove admitted facts and the objection under <span style="text-decoration: underline">Section 91 will not arise unless the plaintiff is called upon to go into evidence.</span> (Mallappa v. Mat an Naga Chetty (1918) 35 M.L.J. 555 : I.L.R. 42 Mad. 41 (F.B.)) </li>
<li>This was the position in Pramatha Nath Sandal v. Dwarka Nath Dey (1896) I.L.R. 23 Cal. 851;<span style="text-decoration: underline"> cf. however</span> Chenbasappa v. Lakshman Ramchandra (1893) I.L.R. 18 Bom. 369, where it was suggested that in a suit on an unstamped <span style="text-decoration: underline">promissory note, even an admission in the written statement may not avail </span>the plaintiff, as the Court when giving a decree on such admission may be “acting on” the document within the meaning of Section 35 of the Stamp Act; see also Ankur Chunder Roy Chowdhry v. Madhub Chunder Gkose (1873) 21 W.R. 1.”</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><u>Admission of Contents of Documents  </u></strong></p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Admission may dispense with proof; but probative value may be less or nil.</li>
<li>Admissibility &amp; probative value – two matters.</li>
</ul>
<p>In State of Bihar v. Radha Krishna Singh, AIR 1983 SC 684, it is observed by our Apex Court as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“Admissibility of a document is one thing and its probative value quite another—these two aspects cannot be combined. A document may be admissible and yet may not carry any conviction and weight or its probative value may be nil.”</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><u>Secondary Evidence – Marked without Objection – Court Examines Probative Value</u></strong></p>
<p>It is well settled that if a party wishes to lead secondary evidence, the Court is obliged to examine the probative value of the document produced in the Court or their contents and decide the question of admissibility of a document in secondary evidence [<strong>Rakesh Mohindra v. Anita Beri:</strong> 2015  AIR(SCW) 6271; <strong><em>Kaliya v. State of MP</em></strong><em>: 2013-10 SCC 758</em>;  H. Siddiqui v. A. Ramalingam: AIR 2011 SC 1492;  Rasiklal Manikchand  v. MSS Food Products: 2012-2 SCC 196].</p>
<p>See Notes below under the heading – </p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“Court examines probative value of secondary evidence”</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><u>Court Has Obligation to Decide Admissibility of Secondary Evidence</u></strong></p>
<p>As shown above, it is held in Kaliya v. State of MP: 2013-10 SCC 758 (relying on  H. Siddiqui v. A. Ramalingam: AIR 2011 SC 1492, and Rasiklal Manikchand  v. MSS Food Products: 2012-2 SCC 196) that the court is obliged to decide the question of admissibility of a document in secondary evidence.</p>
<p>In H. Siddiqui v. A. Ramalingam: AIR 2011 SC 1492 it is held as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“12. The provisions of Section 65 of the 1872 Act provide for permitting the parties to adduce secondary evidence. However, such a course is subject to a large number of limitations. In a case where the original documents are not produced at any time, nor has any factual foundation been laid for giving secondary evidence, it is not permissible for the court to allow a party to adduce secondary evidence. Thus, secondary evidence relating to the contents of a document is inadmissible, until the non-production of the original is accounted for, so as to bring it within one or other of the cases provided for in the section. The secondary evidence must be authenticated by foundational evidence that the alleged copy is in fact a true copy of the original. Mere admission of a document in evidence does not amount to its proof. Therefore, the documentary evidence is required to be proved in accordance with law. The court has an obligation to decide the question of admissibility of a document in secondary evidence before making endorsement thereon. (Vide Roman Catholic Mission v. State of Madras [AIR 1966 SC 1457] , State of Rajasthan v. Khemraj [(2000) 9 SCC 241 : AIR 2000 SC 1759] , LIC v. Ram Pal Singh Bisen [(2010) 4 SCC 491 : (2010) 1 SCC (L&amp;S) 1072 : (2010) 2 SCC (Civ) 191] and M. Chandra v. M. Thangamuthu [(2010) 9 SCC 712 : (2010) 3 SCC (Civ) 907])”.</li>
<li>H. Siddiqui v. A. Ramalingam is followed in U. Sree  v.  U. Srinivas: AIR 2013 SC 415</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><u>Documents Marked by Consent – Does Oral Evidence Need to Prove Contents </u></strong></p>
<p>There are three different views on this matter. They are-</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>1. <span style="text-decoration: underline">There must be oral evidence</span>. Even if consent is given for marking the documents, it will only absolve the parties from formally proving the documents and nothing beyond that. That is, though documents are marked by consent, they could not be relied on unless there is no oral evidence to prove their contents.</li>
<li>2. <span style="text-decoration: underline">Document stands proved</span>. When documents are marked by consent, there is no further need for a formal proof of the documents, it would amount to proof of whatever the documents contained.</li>
<li>3. <span style="text-decoration: underline">If truth is in question it should be specifically proved</span> by proper evidence. In most of the cases, the truth may not remain in question if the contents thereof are proved. But, in rare occasions, even if contents of documents are proved, truth thereof may remain (expressly or implicitly) in question or unrevealed.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">Photocopy of Public Document Marked Without Objection</span></strong></p>
<p>In<strong> Kalita Iqbal Basith v. N Subbalakshmi, (2021) 2 SCC 718</strong>, our Apex Court considered admission of a photocopy of an official document, in the following factual matrix:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li class="has-small-font-size">The failure to produce the originals or certified copies of other documents was properly explained as being untraceable after the death of the brother of P.W.1 who looked after property matters.</li>
<li class="has-small-font-size">The attempt to procure certified copies from the municipality was also unsuccessful as they were informed that the original files were not traceable. </li>
<li class="has-small-font-size"><strong>The photocopies were marked as exhibits without objection.</strong></li>
<li class="has-small-font-size">The respondents never questioned the <strong>genuineness</strong> of the same. </li>
<li class="has-small-font-size">Despite the aforesaid, and the fact that these <strong>documents were more than 30 years old</strong>, were produced from the proper custody of the appellants along with an explanation for non­production of the originals, they were rejected (by the High Court) without any valid reason holding that there could be no presumption that documents executed by a public authority had been issued in proper exercise of statutory powers.</li>
</ul>
<p>In this premises the Supreme Court held as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“This finding in our opinion is clearly perverse in view of Section 114(e) of the Indian Evidence Act 1872, which provides that there shall be a presumption that all official acts have been <strong>regularly performed</strong>. The onus lies on the person who disputes the same to prove otherwise.”</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><u>Court’s Jurisdiction to Require to Prove an Admitted Document</u></strong></p>
<p>The principles in the proviso to Sec. 58 Evidence Act (that the Court may, in its discretion, require the facts admitted to be proved otherwise than by such admissions) apply to category of documents that require specific evidence as to proof of its contents (other than the mere statements in the document).</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>See: Kaliya v. State of MP: 2013 10 SCC 758; Rakesh Mohindra v. Anita Beri: 2015 AIR SCW  6271.</li>
</ul>
<p>In any case, besides the powers of the court under Sec. 165 of Evidence Act, the scheme of the Procedural Acts (Evidence Act, CPC and CrPC) shows that the court has jurisdiction to require the party concerned to prove that document. We can see it in Sec. 58 of Evidence Act, Order XII, Rule 2A Proviso of the CPC and Sec. 294 of the CrPC .</p>
<p>Section 294 of Code of Criminal Procedure reads as follows:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“294. No formal proof of certain documents. (1) Where any document is filed before any Court by the prosecution or the accused, the particulars of every such document shall be included in a list and the prosecution or the accused, as the case may be, or the pleader for the prosecution or the accused, if any, shall be called upon to admit or deny the genuineness of each such document.</li>
<li>(2) The list of documents shall be in such form as may be prescribed by the State Government.</li>
<li>(3) Where the genuineness of any document is not disputed, such document may be read in evidence in any inquiry, trial or other proceeding under this Code without proof of the signature of the person to whom it purports to be signed:</li>
<li>Provided that the Court may, in its discretion, require such signature to be proved.”</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><u>Document Marked for Mere Identification</u></strong></p>
<p>In most cases when a document is admitted in evidence and marked as an Exhibit, proof of its contents stand admitted; so also its truth.  But, if it is evident that it is admitted for mere identification (e.g. when there is already an issue or pleading as to genuineness of a document) it cannot be taken as proved, even if no objection is raised as to marking by the opposite side.</p>
<p>This principle applies to category of documents that require specific evidence as to proof of its contents, apart from the mere statements in the document itself.</p>
<p><strong><u>Relevancy Stand on Another Footing</u></strong><strong></strong></p>
<p>In Pandappa Mahalingappa v. Shivalingappa Murteppa, AIR 1946 Bombay 193, it is observed as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“As held in 10 L.A. 79 and 5 Bom. L.R. 708 the discretion exercised by the trial Court in admitting secondary evidence on the ground that the original is lost should not be interfered with in appeal. But it is urged that the certified copy should not have been exhibited without proof of the execution. From the application (Ex.66) and the roznama it appears that the trial Court exhibited it under S. 90, Evidence Act, on the ground that it was more than 30′ years old. In the lower appellate court the admissibility of the document does not appear to have been challenged. It is urged that as held in 44 Bom. 192 the erroneous omission before the lower Courts to object to the admission of evidence does not make that evidence relevant. The principle of that ruling, however, applies only where the document is per se irrelevant or inadmissible and no objection was taken to its admissibility: 8 Pat. 788. Where evidence is admitted in the trial Court without any objection to its reception, and the evidence is admissible and relevant, then no objection will be allowed to be taken to its reception at any stage of the litigation on the ground of improper proof. But if the evidence is irrelevant or inadmissible, as for instance, owing to want of registration, omission to take objection to its reception does not make it admissible, and the objection may be raised even in appeal for the first time; 28 L.A. 106. As observed by Das J. in A.L.R. 1922 Pat. 122 “the question of relevancy is a question of law and can be raised at any stage, but the question of proof is a question of procedure, and is capable of being waived.“</li>
<li>In this case the secondary evidence of the mortgage-deed was held to be admissible as the original was lost. What is now urged is that the execution should have been proved and this objection was not raised either in the trial Court or in the lower appellate Court. It is however true that no evidence was adduced to prove the execution of the original of Ex.68 as the trial Court was prepared to raise the presumption in favour of the genuineness of the document under S. 90, Evidence Act. Whether such a presumption can be raised or not is a question of law, and it can, therefore, be urged at any stage of the litigation. It is now well settled by the ruling of the Privy Council in 37 Bom. L.R. 805 that the statutory presumption under S. 90, Evidence Act, cannot be made in respect of a document merely on production of its copy under S. 65 of the Act. Their Lordships observed (p. 811) “Section 90 clearly requires the production to the Court of the particular document in regard to which the Court may make the statutory presumption. If the document produced is a copy, admitted under S.65 as secondary evidence, and it is produced from proper custody, and is over 30 years old, then the signatures authenticating the copy may be presumed to be genuine.”</li>

<p><strong><u>EFFECT OF MARKING DOCUMENTS WITHOUT OBJECTION</u></strong></p>
<p>Effect of marking a document without formal proof on admission (or without objection) is also a subject of controversy.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-table is-style-regular"><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>First view</strong></td><td>Admission of contents &amp; it dispenses with proof.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Second View</strong></td><td>Admission of contents – but, does not dispense with proof.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Third view</strong></td><td>If <em><u>truth is in issue</u></em>, mere proof of contents, or marking without objection, is not proof of truth.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Fourth view</strong></td><td>Admission of contents, dispenses with proof and truth; but its <em><u>probative value</u></em> will be a matter for appreciation by court.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Fifth view</strong></td><td>Court should <em><u>require</u></em> (in proper cases) the party producing the document to adduce proper evidence as to execution, and to cure formal defects.</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>
<p><strong><u>Propositions Analysed</u></strong></p>
<p><strong><u>1. Marked Without Objection – Its ‘Contents’ Stand Proved</u></strong>,<strong><u> as Admission</u></strong></p>
<p>(a) <strong><u>Proof of execution may be enough</u></strong>: <strong>Its</strong> <strong>‘Contents’ stand proved</strong><strong>:</strong> Exhibiting of documents in evidence without objection amounts to ‘admission’ of its contents. Admission is taken in law as an important characteristic. In this premises, proof of execution may be enough; and no separate proof be needed. </p>
<p>When a document is marked without objection, its ‘contents’ stand proved. See: <strong>RVE Venkatachala Gounder v. Arulmigu Viswesaraswami</strong>: AIR 2003  SC  4548. See also:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Narbada Devi  v. Birendra Kumar: (2003) 8 SCC 745</li>
<li>Dayamati Bai v. K.M. Shaffi : AIR 2004 SC 4082</li>
<li>Oriental Insurance Co v. Premlata:  (2007) 8 SCC 575</li>
<li>Thimmappa Rai v. Ramanna Rai,(2007) 14 SCC 63.</li>
</ul>
<p>(b) <strong><u>Proof of Execution may not be Enough</u>:</strong> Exhibiting of documents in evidence, without objection, and proving the same before the court are two different process. </p>
<p>In certain cases, as comes out from Sec. 56, 57 and 58 of the Evidence Act, when a document is admitted, separate proof need not be warranted. Separate proof may not be required when presumptions can be invoked (e.g. document in ordinary course of business, a letter obtained in reply).</p>
<p>(c) <strong><u>Factual foundation to give secondary evidence must be established</u></strong>: </p>
<p>Contents of documents are presented in two ways:</p>
<ol class="wp-block-list" style="list-style-type:1">
<li>documents in original</li>
<li>(by way) of secondary evidence.</li>
</ol>
<p>The party has to lay down the factual foundation to establish the right to give secondary evidence where the original document cannot be produced [Rakesh MohindraVs. Anita Beri: 2015AIR(SCW) 6271].</p>
<p><strong>Secondary-evidence</strong> <strong>–</strong> <strong>Marked Without Objection</strong> – <strong>Objection stands waived</strong>. When the party gives in evidence a certified-copy/secondary-evidence without proving the circumstances entitling him to give secondary evidence, the opposite party must raise his objection (if so) at the time of admission of such documents. In case, an objection is not raised at that point of time, it is precluded from being raised at a belated stage. It stands waived. [<strong>Kalita Iqbal Basith v. N Subbalakshmi, </strong>(2021) 2 SCC 718<strong>;</strong> <strong>Kaliya v. State of MP:</strong> 2013-10 SCC 758]</p>
<p><strong><u>2. Mere Marking– Not Dispense with Proof</u></strong> (of truth of contents)</p>
<p>In <strong>Sait Tarajee Khimchand v. Yelamarti Satyam</strong>, AIR 1971 SC 1865, the Supreme Court observed that mere marking of documents (day book and ledger) as exhibits do not dispense with the proof of documents. In <strong>Nandkishore Lalbhai Mehta v. New Era Fabrics</strong>, AIR 2015 SC 3796, it is observed that mere marking as exhibit and identification of executor’s signature by one of witnesses do not prove contents of a document.</p>
<p>In <strong><em>Kaliya v. State of Madhya Pradesh</em></strong><em> (</em>2013-10 SCC 758) it is held as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“Mere admission of a document in evidence does not amount to its proof. Nor, mere marking of exhibit on a document does not dispense with its proof, which is otherwise required to be done in accordance with law. (Vide: The Roman Catholic Mission v. The State, AIR 1966 SC 1457; Marwari Khumhar v. Bhagwanpuri Guru Ganeshpuri AIR 2000 SC 2629; RVE Venkatachala Gounder v. Arulmigu AIR 2003 SC 4548; Smt. Dayamathi Bai v. K.M. Shaffi, AIR 2004 SC 4082; and LIC of India  v. Rampal Singh Bisen,2010-4 SCC 491).”</li>
<li>[Note: Further held: “In case, an objection is not raised at that point of time, it is precluded from being raised at a belated stage.”]</li>
</ul>
<p>In Dibakar Behera v. Padmabati Behera, AIR 2008 Ori 92, it is observed <strong>[</strong>referring RVE Venkatachala Gounder v. Arulmigu Viswesaraswami, AIR 2003  SC  4548, Dayamati Bai v. K.M. Shaffi, 2004 SC 4082, Bhagyarathi Das v. Agadhu Charan Das, 62 (1986) CLT 298,  Budhi Mahal v. Gangadhar Das, 46 (1978) CLT 287 etc.<strong>]</strong> that a close reading of the above judicial pronouncements would show that whenever a document is marked as exhibit without objection, it will be presumed that a party having right of objection has waived formal proof of the document and in such situation, the entire contents of the document would be admissible in evidence. How ever, by such admission of document, the truth and correctness of the contents by it self would not be established and there must be some evidence to support the contents of such document.</p>
<p>Secondary evidence relating to the contents of a document is inadmissible, until the non-production of the original is accounted for. The secondary evidence must be authenticated by foundational evidence that the alleged copy is in fact a true copy of the original. Mere admission of a document in evidence does not amount to its proof. Therefore, the documentary evidence is required to be proved in accordance with law.</p>
<p>The court has an obligation to decide the question of admissibility of a document in secondary evidence before making endorsement thereon. [H. Siddiqui v. A. Ramalingam: AIR 2011 SC 1492; Nandkishore Lalbhai Mehta v. New Era Fabrics: AIR  2015  SC 3796]</p>
<p>In Rakesh Mohindra v. Anita Beri [2015AIR(SCW) 6271] it is held:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“Mere admission of secondary evidence, does not amount to its proof. The genuineness, correctness and existence of the document shall have to be established during the trial and the trial court shall record the reasons before relying on those secondary evidences.”</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><u>3. IF ‘TRUTH’ IS IN ISSUE- Mere Marking Not Amounts to ‘Waiver’</u></strong></p>
<p>The fundamental principles as to proof of a document is that the proof must be given by a person who can vouchsafe for the Truth of its contents (<em>Narbada Devi Gupta v. Birendra Kumar Jaiswal, 2003-8 SCC 745).</em></p>
<p>It is legitimate to say that this requirement as to proof of ‘truth’ is independent from inviting ‘proof of signature and handwriting’ in Sec. 67 to 71 of the Evidence Act. This proposition is clear from Sec. 67, which lays down the fundamental principles as to the proof of documents. Sec. 67 reads as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“67. <span style="text-decoration: underline">Proof of signature and handwriting of person alleged to have signed or written document produced</span>—If a document is alleged to be signed or to have been written wholly or in part by any person, the signature or the handwriting of so much of the document as is alleged to be in that person’s handwriting must be proved to be in his handwriting.”</li>
</ul>
<p>Though proof of execution (dealt with in Sec. 67 to 71) is independent from proof as to ‘truth’ of contents of a document, proof as to ‘truth’ can be presumed by the court, in most cases, on ‘proof of execution’. It is more so, when a document is admitted without objection. Proof as to ‘truth’ of contents is essential if ‘truth’ is in issue, or in dispute. It rarely occurs.</p>
<p><strong>If ‘TRUTH’ is in issue, or in dispute,</strong> <em>marking a document without objection, or mere proof of handwriting or execution</em>,<em> </em>by itself, need not absolve the duty to prove the truth as to the contents of the documents. (<strong>Ramji Dayawala Vs. Invest Import</strong>, AIR 1981 SC 2085; Achuthan Pillai vs Marikar (Motors) Ltd., AIR 1983 Ker 81; Suresh v. Tobin, 2013-1 KerLT 293). Court has a duty to see that the statement of a witness gets independent corroboration, direct or circumstantial, in proper cases (Ahalya Bariha v. Chhelia Padhan, 1992 Cri.LJ 493).</p>
<p>In <strong>Ramji Dayawala Vs. Invest Import</strong>: AIR 1981 SC 2085, it us held as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“If the truth of the facts stated in a document is in issue mere proof of the handwriting and execution of the document would not furnish evidence of the truth of the facts or contents of the document. The truth or otherwise of the facts or contents so stated would have to be proved by admissible evidence, i.e. by the evidence of those persons who can vouchsafe for the truth of the facts in issue.”</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline">Presumption on a registered document and undue influence under S. 16, Contract Act</span>: In Lakshmi v. Muthusamy, 2012(1) CTC 53 it was contended that there was presumption on a registered document that the contents of the said document are true and genuine (Vimalchand Ghevarchand Jain v.  Ramakant Eknath Jadoo, 2009-5 SCC 713, relied on). The Madras High Court (S. Nagamuthu, J.) rejected the argument for, there was another question – whether the plaintiff had discharged the burden of proving ‘absence of undue influence’ as contemplated in Section 16 of the Indian Contract Act which provided for the burden of proof of absence of undue influence. It was pointed out that once the initial burden of proving the position of the plaintiff to dominate the will of the defendant was discharged, the burden was shifted on the plaintiff to prove absence of undue influence. The Court found it not safe to rely on the evidence of the plaintiff alone to hold absence undue influence on the part of the plaintiff. The High Court relied on the Supreme Court decision in Krishnamohan Kul v. Pratima Maity, (2004) 9 SCC 468, where it was held as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“The onus to prove the validity of the deed of settlement was on Defendant 1. When fraud, mis-representation or undue influence is alleged by a party to the suit, normally, the burden is on him to prove such fraud, undue influence or mis-representation. But when a person is in a fiduciary relationship with another and the latter is in a position of active confidence the burden of proving the absence of fraud, mis-representation or undue influence is upon the person in the dominating position, and he has to prove that there was fair play in the transaction and that the apparent is the real, in other words, that the transaction is genuine and bona fide. In such a case, the burden of proving the good faith of the transaction is thrown upon the dominant party, that is to say, the party who is in a position of active confidence. A person standing in a fiduciary relation to another has a duty to protect the interest given to his care and the court watches with jealously all transactions between such persons so that the protector may not use his influence or the confidence to his advantage. When the party complaining shows such relation, the law presumes everything against the transaction and the onus is cast upon the person holding the position of confidence or trust to show that the transaction is perfectly fair and reasonable, that no advantage has been taken of his position. This principle has been ingrained in Section 111 of the Indian Evidence Act.”</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline">If payment disputed, mere marking of a registered sale deed not sufficient.</span> In Suresh CV v. Tobin, ILR 2013(1) Ker. 30: 2013-1 KLT 293, the Kerala High Court held that if payment of price for sale was disputed, such fact would not be proved by mere production and marking of a registered sale deed which stated or narrated the payment, and that it was necessary to adduce oral evidence to prove such fact. The Court relied on Ramji Dayawala Vs. Invest Import (AIR 1981 SC 2085) which held that if the truth of the facts stated in a document is in issue mere proof of the handwriting and execution of the document would not furnish evidence of the truth of the facts or contents of the document and that the truth or otherwise of the facts or contents so stated would have to be proved by admissible evidence i.e. by the evidence of those persons who can vouchsafe for the truth of the facts in issue.</p>
<p><strong><u>4. Admission of Contents</u> <u>– May dispense with proof</u>; <u>but <em>Probative Value</em> may be less or nil</u></strong></p>
<p>Admissibility &amp; probative value – two matters. State of Bihar v. Radha Krishna Singh (AIR 1983 SC 684) it is observed:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><em>“Admissibility of a document is one thing and its probative value quite another—these two aspects cannot be combined. A document may be admissible and yet may not carry any conviction and weight or its probative value may be nil.”</em></li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">Court examines probative value of secondary evidence</span></strong>: </p>
<p>It is well settled that if a party wishes to lead secondary evidence, the Court is obliged to examine the probative value of the document produced in the Court or their contents and decide the question of admissibility of a document in secondary evidence, Rakesh Mohindra v. Anita Beri: 2015  AIR(SCW) 6271.</p>
<p>Contents of the document cannot be proved by mere filing the document in a court. Under the Law of Evidence, it is necessary that contents of documents are required to be proved either by primary or by secondary evidence. Mere marking a document as an ‘exhibit’ will not absolve the duty of to prove the documents in accordance with the provisions of the Evidence Act. At the most, marking ‘exhibit’may amount to proof of contents, but not its truth.</p>
<p>Documents which are not produced and marked as required under the Evidence Act cannot be relied upon by the Court.</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>See: LIC v. Ram Pal Singh Bisen: 2010-4 SCC 491 (Filing of the Inquiry Report or the evidence adduced during the domestic enquiry); </li>
<li>M. Chandra v. M. Thangamuthu, AIR 2015 SC 3796. </li>
<li>Nandkishore Lalbhai Mehta Vs.New Era Fabrics: AIR 2015 SC 3796; </li>
<li>Birad Mal SinghviVs. Anand Purohitb: 1988 (Supp) SCC 604 (date of birth)</li>
</ul>
<p>Even when a document is technically admitted in court, the probative value thereof will always be a matter for the court to determine. That is, it is depended upon the nature of each case. The probative value of Scene-Mahazar, Postmortem Report, photocopy of a Registered Deed etc. without supporting legal evidence may be lesser. In such cases the court can refrain from acting upon such documents until regular evidence is tendered.</p>
<p>In Kaliya v. State of MP: 2013-10 SCC 758 (relying on  H. Siddiqui v. A. Ramalingam: AIR 2011 SC 1492, and Rasiklal Manikchand  v. MSS Food Products: 2012-2 SCC 196) held as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“The court is obliged to examine the probative value of documents produced in court or their contents and decide the question of admissibility of a document in secondary evidence.”</li>
<li>[Note: Further held: “In case, an objection is not raised at that point of time, it is precluded from being raised at a belated stage.”]</li>
</ul>
<p>In Life Insurance Corporation of India  v. Ram Pal Singh Bisen [2010-4 SCC 491], it is observed as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“26. We are of the firm opinion that mere admission of document in evidence does amount to its proof. In other words, mere marking of exhibit on a document does dispense with its proof, which is required to be done in accordance with law. …..27. It was the duty of the appellants to have proved documents Exh.-A-1 to Exh. A-10 in accordance with law. Filing of the Inquiry Report or the evidence adduced during the domestic enquiry would partake the character of admissible evidence in Court of law. That documentary evidence was also required to be proved by the appellants in accordance with the provisions of the Evidence Act, which they have failed to do.”</li>
</ul>
<p>The Calcutta High Court quoting Life Insurance Corporation of India v. Ram Pal Singh Bisen, 2010-4 SCC 491, it is observed in Bajaj Allianz General Insurance Company v. Smt. Santa, 2019-2 ACC 36,  that ‘even if the document had been marked as Exhibit-A without objection, without a formal proof thereof in accordance with the provisions of the Evidence Act, such document lost its credibility and is of no probative value’.</p>
<p>In Kalyan Singh, v. Chhoti, AIR 1990 SC 396, it is observed as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“A certified copy of a registered sale deed may be produced as secondary evidence in the absence of the original. But in the present case Ex. 3 is not certified copy. It is just an ordinary copy. There is also no evidence regarding content of the original sale deed. Ex.3 cannot therefore, be considered as secondary evidence. The appellate Court has a right and duty to exclude such evidence.”</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>5.</strong> <strong><u>Court should <em>allow</em> concerned party, to adduce proper evidence to prove documents</u></strong></p>
<p>As stated in detail above, besides the powers of the court under Sec. 165 of Evidence Act, the scheme of the Procedural Acts shows that the court has jurisdiction to require the party concerned to prove that document. (Sec. 58 of Evidence Act and Order XII, Rule 2A Proviso of the CPC and Sec. 294 of the CrPC).</p>
<p>Defect for not producing a proper power of attorney being curable, in Haryana State Coop.  Supply and Marketing Federation Ltd. v. Jayam Textiles, 2014 AIR SC 1926 (a case under Section 138 Negotiable instruments Act), the Apex Court gave opportunity to the petitioner to produce the authorization of Board of Directors. It is observed that the in Raj Narian v. Indira Nehru Gandhi, (1972) 3 SCC 850 it was held that the rules of pleadings are intended as aids for a fair trial and for reaching a just decision. This principle is reiterated in ever so many cases. They include:</p>

</ul>
<p>In Shail Kumari v. Saraswati Devi, 96 (2002) DLT 131, it is observed as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“14. In case a document is marked exhibit without an objection from the party which is affected by that document ordinarily its admissibility cannot be questioned at a later stage of the proceedings in the suit. But in cases where such document is marked exhibit without due application of mind in violation of provisions of a statute requiring a particular mode of proof etc., the opposite party may still show during the hearing of final arguments that the document is inadmissible in evidence and should be excluded from consideration because of statutory bar or non-compliance of statutory requirement about mode of proof or otherwise. For instance a will is required to be proved by examining at least one of the attesting witnesses in accordance with Section 68 of the Evidence Act. A document which is inadmissible for want of registration or proper stamp is inadmissible in evidence, unless use of it is permissible for collateral purposes or extracts of accounts book without production of books of account and proof that they were kept in ordinary course of business. Mere putting of exhibits number on these documents in the absence of their proof in accordance with law does not make them part of the evidence to be read for deciding the suit.”</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">When Execution of Will is Admitted, Should it be Proved</span>?</strong></p>
<p>Section 68 of the Evidence Act, 1872 mandates examination of one attesting witness at least to prove documents required by law to be attested (including Wills). When execution of a Will is ‘Admitted’ by the opposite side, should it be ‘Proved’?</p>
<p>There is difference of opinion.</p>
<p>Following latest decisions assuredly lay down that when execution of the will is ‘admitted’ by the opposite side, it <strong><u>need not be ‘proved’</u></strong> as required in Sec. 68 (by examining at least one witness).</p>

<p>Following decisions laid down that even when execution of a will was ‘admitted’ by the opposite side, it <strong><u>must have been ‘proved’</u></strong> by examining at least one attesting witness.</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>S.R. Srinivas v. S. Padmavathamma, (2010) 5 SCC 274 – It is observed – the execution of a Will can be held to have been proved only when the statutory requirements for proving the Will are satisfied. Admission in the pleadings as to the Will can only be about the “making of the Will” and not the “genuineness of the Will”.</li>
<li>Vadakkayil Gopalan v. Vadakkayil Paru, (2013) 3 KerLT 69 –It is observed – proof of the Will by examining at least one witness was necessary (even if the Will has been admitted in the pleadings).</li>
<li>Poulose A. V. v. Indira M.R., 2010 (3) KerLT Suppl. 185 : ILR 2010 Ker.388  – It is observed – No distinction is drawn, by Sec. 68, between an admitted Will and a disputed Will in the mode of proof of execution; and therefore, in all cases in which the Will is set up the procedure prescribed in Sec. 68 will have to be followed.</li>
<li>Ramesh Verma v. Lajesh Saxena (2017) 1 SCC 257 – It is observed – the mandate of Section 68 of the Evidence Act has to be followed even in a case where the opposite party does not specifically deny the execution of the document in the written statement.</li>
<li>Sarada v. Radhamani, 2017 (2) KLT 327. In this decision, rendered in a ‘Refence’ to resolve the dispute in the question we discuss, the Kerala High Court (DB) referred all the above decisions. And, declared the following decisions, as <strong>Per Incuriam</strong>

<li>Princelal G. v.

<li>Thayyullathil Kunhikannan v. Thayyullathil Kalliani, AIR 1990 Ker.226 – Relying on Order VIII Rule 5 C.P.C. and Sec. 58 of the Indian Evidence Act, it is held that when the execution of the Will is admitted, there will not be any requirement to prove the Will.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>P. Malliga v. P. Kumaran, 2022 (2) LW 393, (Followed in Ranga Pillai v. Mannar Pillai, 2022, Mad) – It is held by the Madras High Court that a Will shall not be used as evidence until it is proved in the manner prescribed under Section 68 of the Evidence Act. The judge did not agree the view in P. Radha v. Irudayadoss, 2022 SCCOnline Mad 886. (Note: This decision, P. Malliga v. P. Kumaran, is overruled in <strong>Boomathi v.

</ul>
<p><strong><u>S. 68 to be Followed, Even When the Opp. party does not Deny Execution</u></strong></p>
<p>Sec. 68 of the Evidence Act reads as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“68. Proof of execution of document required by law to be attested—If a document is required by law to be attested, it shall not be used as evidence until one attesting witness at least has been called for the purpose of proving its execution, if there be an attesting witness alive, and subject to the process of the Court and capable of giving evidence:</li>
<li>Provided that it shall not be necessary to call an attesting witness in proof of the execution of any document, <strong><em><u>not being a will</u></em></strong>, which has been registered in accordance with the provisions of the Indian Registration Act, 1908 (16 of 1908), unless its execution by the person by whom it purports to have been executed is specifically denied.</li>
</ul>
<p>In Ramesh Verma v. Rajesh Saxena, 2017-1 SCC 257, our Apex Court held as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“13. A will like any other document is to be proved in terms of the provisions of Sec. 68 of the Evidence Act and the Succession Act, 1925. The propounder of the will is called upon to show by satisfactory evidence that the will was signed by the testator, that the testator at the relevant time was in a sound and disposing state of mind, that he understood the nature and effect of the disposition and put his signature to the document on his own free will and the document shall not be used as evidence until one attesting witness at least has been called for the purpose of proving its execution. This is the mandate of Sec. 68 of the Evidence Act and the position remains the same even in a case where the opposite party does <strong>not specifically deny</strong> the execution of the document in the written statement.”</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><u>Effect of ‘Admission’ of Execution of Will (by the other side</u></strong><strong>)</strong></p>
<p>It may be pointed out that the Apex Court did not consider in this decision, Ramesh Verma v. Rajesh Saxena – what is the position when the opposite party <strong>expressly admit</strong> the execution of the document.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline">Boomathi v. Murugesan, 2023-2 Mad LJ 684 (DB)</span></p>
<p>It is held in a recent Division Bench decision in <strong>Boomathi v. Murugesan</strong>, 2023-2 Mad LJ 684, that the position will be different if the Will is<strong> ‘categorically’ and ‘clearly’ <u>admitted</u></strong>. The Madras High Court referred Sec. 17 (Admission) and Sec. 58 (Facts admitted need not be proved) and came to the conclusion , Sec. 68 will not be attracted where the Will is “<strong>admitted</strong>” by the other side. The Division Bench held as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“23. First and foremost, it is to be borne in mind that before the Hon’ble Supreme Court in Jagdish Chand Sharma Vs. Narain Singh Saini [Dead] through Legal Representatives and Others, reported in 2015 [8] SCC 615, the validity of the Will was a core issue and the Hon’ble Supreme Court  proceeded to discuss the law with regard to proof of a Will in accordance with the statute. In such context, the Hon’ble Supreme Court has held that the position with regard to proof of a Will remains the same even if the opposite party does not specifically deny execution of the same.</li>
<li>24. The above judgment has been followed by learned Single Judges of this Court in  P. Malliga Vs. P. Kumaran reported in 2022 [2] LW 393 and Akkinirajan Vs. Maheswari and Others reported in 2023 [1] LW 72.</li>
<li>25. This Court draws the distinction between <strong>‘specifically denied’, ‘not specifically denied’</strong> and ‘<strong>admitted</strong>‘. The first two instances, namely, ‘specifically denied’ and ‘not specifically denied’, would fall within one category. Insofar as proof of a Will in both cases in this category, the Will would have to be necessarily proved by the propounder. However, where the opposite party <strong><em><u>categorically admits</u></em></strong> to the Will, the position would be certainly different. In India, we follow what is called the system ‘adversarial proceedings’, which is also followed in the British Courts. The foundation of this School is that parties before a Court would have to deal with facts in issue namely facts that are asserted and denied by the parties to the lis and the Court would proceed to adjudicate on such issues. When there is no dispute between the parties on certain matters, the Court would not venture to require proof of such admitted facts.”</li>
<li>“33. This Court has applied its mind to the various principles laid down by the Hon’ble  Supreme Court as well as this Court and other High Courts, especially in the context of Sec. 68 of the Indian Evidence Act, proof of a Will where execution is not specifically denied and in cases where the execution is <strong><u>categorically admitted.</u></strong> The ratio laid down by the Hon’ble Supreme Court in Ramesh Verma’s case [cited supra] reported in 2017 [1] SCC 257, cannot be a precedent for the proposition where the opposite party <strong>clearly admits</strong> to the execution of the subject Will as in the instant case. Therefore, we are not in respectful agreement with the judgments in P. Malliga’s case(P. Malliga v. P. Kumaran, 2022 (2) LW 393) andAkkinirajan’s case (Akkinirajan Vs. Maheswari, 2023 [1] LW 72) following the ratio laid down by the Hon’ble Supreme Court in Jagdish Chand Sharma’s case. On the contrary, we approve the ratio laid down in <strong>P. Radha Vs. Irudayadoss</strong> and Others reported in 2022 SCC Online Mad 886 and Vanjiammal and Others Vs. Vidya and Others in the order dtd. 21/4/2017 made in CRP.[PD] No.3659/2013.”</li>
</ul>
<p>The same view is taken in <strong>Rajeev Gupta v. Prashant Garg, 2022-1 All LJ 435</strong>. The court held as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“The <strong><u>admission</u></strong> were in the pleadings of the parties and therefore there was no requirement of proving the will in the present suit. Admittedly, the defendant Nos. 2 to 4/appellants have claimed their title through Ramesh Chand Garg who never disputed the validity of the will rather in the Original Suit No. 458 of 1992, he admitted its validity and therefore, the lower appellate court has rightly decreed the suit and held that the will was neither required to be proved in the present suit nor the filing of original will was necessary.”</li>

<li>First: Requirement of <strong>calling at lest one witness</strong> to prove those documents that requires attestation, remains the same <strong>even in a case </strong>where the opposite party <strong>expressly admit</strong> the execution of the document in the written statement.</li>
<li>Second: If the Will is <strong>(even impliedly) admitted</strong>, Sec. 68 need not be invoked.</li>
<li>Third: If only the Will is <strong><u>expressly</u> admitted</strong>, then only there will be alleviation of burden laid down in Sec. 68.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the light of the Apex Court decision in Ramesh Verma v. Rajesh Saxena, 2017-1 SCC 257, <sub>(that the position – as to proof of documents requires attestation – remains the same even in a case where the opposite party does <strong>not specifically deny</strong> the execution of the document in the written statement)</sub> it appears that the second view stated above (taken in Thayyullathil Kunhikannan v. Thayyullathil Kalliani, AIR 1990 Ker 226) is not sustainable.</p>
<p>But, the proposition of law in the third view above, applied in <strong>Boomathi v. Murugesan</strong> (supra), and other decisions <sub>(that the position – as to proof of documents requires attestation – will be different if the Will is <strong>“categorically <u>admitted</u>“</strong>),</sub> sounds good.</p>
<p><strong><u>Authoritative Judicial Pronouncement is yet to be Arrived</u></strong></p>
<p>It is also pertinent to note that the Kerala High Court, in <strong>Sarada v. Radhamani</strong> (supra), pointed out that the general provisions of Sect. 58 of the Evidence Act has ‘to give way to the special provisions’ of Sec. 68 of the Act; and it was remarked that there was no distinction between an ‘admitted Will’ and a ‘disputed Will’ as to the mode of proof.</p>
<p>It appears that the placing the doctrine of <em><u>‘specific provisions override general provisions</u></em>‘ is rational; for, the following words in Sec. 68 places a ‘non-obstante clause’ –</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“it shall <strong><u>not be used as evidence</u></strong> until one attesting witness at least has been called for the purpose of proving its execution”.</li>
</ul>
<p>However, it will also be a forceful argument if one says that a section in the Evidence Act cannot be protected from certain fundamental principles of the Evidence Act which include ‘best evidence rule’, ‘admitted facts need not be proved’ etc., unless strong persuasive indications are laid down in the provision concerned. (It is also noteworthy that Sec. 68 does not proceed with a non-obstante clause.) In any event, the scheme of the Evidence Act shows that Chapter III (the beginning Chapter of Part II) which deals with “Facts Need Not be Proved”, is meant to govern the succeeding chapters including the Chapter V that deals with ‘Documentary Evidence’ wherein Sec. 68 is included.</p>
<p>It is also significant – Sec. 58 says that ‘Admitted facts need not be <strong><u>proved</u></strong>’; and Sec. 68 speaks as to “<strong><u>Proof</u></strong> of execution of document required by law to be attested” and that the attesting witness is called “for the purpose of <strong><u>proving</u></strong> its execution”. That is, the question of ‘proof’ under Sec. 68 does not arise if ‘execution of document’ has already been admitted by the other side.</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Note: Proviso to Sec. 58 enables the court to require proof, despite the admission of the other side, if it finds proper. Proviso to Sec. 58 reads as under:</li>
<li>“Provided that the Court may, in its discretion, require the facts admitted to be proved otherwise than by such admissions.”</li>
</ul>
<p>Therefore, an authoritative judicial pronouncement is yet to be arrived, taking note of various potential contentions in this regard.</p>
<p><strong><u>INSUFFICIENTLY STAMPED DOCUMENTS </u></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">Instruments not duly stamped, inadmissible</span></strong></p>
<p>Insufficiency of Stamp: Sec. 35 of the Indian Stamp Act reads as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“35. Instruments not duly stamped inadmissible in evidence, etc.- No instrument chargeable with duty shall be admitted in evidence for any purpose by any person having by law or consent of parties authority to receive evidence, or shall be acted upon, registered or authenticated by any such person or by any public officer, unless such instrument is duly stamped:</li>
<li>Provided that-(a)any such instrument shall be admitted in evidence on payment of the duty with which the same is chargeable or, in the case of an instrument insufficiently stamped, of the amount required to make up such duty, together with a penalty of five rupees, or, when ten times the amount of the proper duty or deficient portion thereof exceeds five rupees, of a sum equal to ten times such duty or portion; … ….. ….”</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">Unstamped document cannot be looked at even for any collateral purpose</span></strong></p>
<p>Privy Council in Ram Rattan v. Parma Nath,<strong> </strong>AIR 1946 PC 51, held that section 35 of the Stamp Act prohibited the unstamped (or inadequately stamped) document from being looked at even for any collateral purpose, as it enacts that no instrument chargeable with duty shall be admitted in evidence ‘for any purpose’. The unstamped (or inadequately stamped) document becomes admissible on payment of penalty under Stamp Act or on payment of the stamp duty after impounding.</p>
<p><strong><u>Pay Duty With Penalty to Admit Unstamped Deed for Collateral Purpose</u></strong></p>
<p>In Yellapu Uma Maheswari v. Buddha Jagadheeswararao, (2015) 16 SCC 787, the Apex Court held in the suit for declaration of title that an unregistered document can be relied upon for collateral purposes i.e. to prove his possession, payment of sale consideration and nature of possession; but not for primary purpose i.e. sale between the plaintiff and defendant or its terms. It is held as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“In a suit for partition, an unregistered document can be relied upon for collateral purpose i.e. severancy of title, nature of possession of various shares but not for the primary purpose i.e. division of joint properties by metes and bounds. An unstamped instrument is not admissible in evidence even for collateral purpose, until the same is impounded. Hence, if the appellant-defendant wants to mark these documents for collateral purpose it is open for them to pay the stamp duty together with penalty and get the document impounded and the trial court is at liberty to mark Exts. B-21 and B-22 for collateral purpose subject to proof and relevance.” </li>
</ul>
<p>Section 49 of the Registration Act expressly states admissibility of unregistered documents  in evidence for collateral purposes. The word ‘collateral’ signifies something beyond or parallel. According to Law Lexicon it means “that which is by the side, and not the direct line; that which is additional to or beyond a thing” (Amit Khanna.  Vs Suchi Khanna, 2008-10 ADJ 426; 2009-75 AllLR 34; 2009-1 AWC 929).</p>
<p>The Supreme  Court observed in Sri Venkoba Rao Pawar v. Sri S. Chandrashekar, AIR 2008 SCW 4829, that the collateral purpose/transaction must be independent of, or divisible from the transaction which requires registration.</p>
<p><strong><u>UNREGISTERED DOCUMENTS – Effect of Marking Without Objection</u></strong></p>
<p>Under section 49 of the Registration Act, if a document required to be registered is not registered, it is not admissible in evidence ; and such unregistered document can only be used as an evidence of collateral purpose.</p>
<p>With respect to Unregistered (Necessarily Registrable) Documents it is held by the Apex Court in <strong>K.B. Saha and Sons Private Limited v. Development Consultant Ltd,</strong> (2008) 8 SCC 564: AIR 2008 SC (Supp) 850, as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“34. From the principles laid down in the various decisions of this Court and the High Courts, as referred to here-in-above, it is evident that :</li>
<li>A document required to be registered is not admissible into evidence under section 49 of the Registration Act.</li>
<li>Such unregistered document can however be used as an evidence of collateral purpose as provided in the Proviso to section 49 of the Registration Act. ….”</li>
</ul>
<p>In the light of the Supreme Court decision in <strong>K.B. Saha and Sons Private Limited</strong> , it appears that the observation of the Karnataka High Court in Nanda Behera v. Akhsaya Kumar Behera, 2017AIR (CC) 1893, that once the Court, rightly or wrongly, decides to admit the documents in evidence, so far as the parties are concerned, the matter is closed, is not applicable to unregistered (compulsorily registrable) documents.</p>
<p>However, the Calcutta High Court in Dipak Kumar Singh v. Park Street Properties (P) Limited, AIR 2014 Cal 167, distinguished K.B. Saha &amp; Sons Private Limited, (2008) 8 SCC 564, and other decisions saying that ‘the question of admissibility of a document, which had been admitted in evidence, was not taken up for consideration’ in those decisions. The High Court relied on Javer Chand v. Pukhraj Surana, AIR 1961 SC 1655 (question as to admissibility on the ground that it has not been stamped), which held that once a document had been marked as an exhibit in a case and the trial had proceeded all along on the footing that the document was an exhibit in the case and had been used by the parties in examination and cross-examination of their witnesses, it was not open either to the trial court itself or to a court of appeal or revision to go behind that order.</p>
<p>The other decisions referred to and distinguished in Dipak Kumar Singh v. Park Street Properties (P) Limited are the following: Ram Kumar Das v. Jagdish Chandra Deo, Dhabal Deb: AIR 1952 SC 23, Satish Chand Makhan v. Govardhan Das Byas: (1984) 1 SCC 369, Anthony v. K.C. Ittoop: (2000) 6 SCC 394, Surya Kumar Manji v.

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Section 36 of the Stamp Act</strong> – <strong>Once admitted shall NOT</strong> <strong>be called in question</strong></span></p>

</ul>
<p>A document purporting to be an unregistered sale deed was marked as an Exhibit. The High Court directed that the aforesaid document should be de-marked and not be treated as an exhibit. The Apex Court held in <strong>Sirikonda Madhava Rao v. N. Hemalatha</strong>, 12 April, 2022 (referring Javer Chand v. Pukhraj Surana, (1962-2 SCR 333 and Shyamal Kumar Roy v.

<ul class="wp-block-list">

<p>In Lothamasu Sambasiva Rao v.

</ol>
<p>The Karnataka High Court held in Smt. Savithramma R.C v. M/s. Vijaya Bank, AIR 2015 Kar 175, as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li class="has-small-font-size">“6. From the aforesaid statutory provisions and the decisions, it is clear that a duty is cast upon every judge to examine every document, which is produced or comes before him in the performance of his functions. On such examination, if it appears to the Judge that such instrument is not duly stamped, an obligation is cast upon him to impound the same. This duty is to be performed by the Judge irrespective of the fact whether any objection to its marking is raised or not. Hence, there is a need for diligence on the part of the Court having regard to the statutory obligation under Section 33 of the Karnataka Stamp Act. Section 34 of the Karnataka Stamp Act<strong>*</strong> mandates that an instrument, which is not duly stamped shall not be admitted in evidence. If any objection is taken to the admissibility of the evidence, it shall be decided then and there. If this document is found to be insufficiently stamped, then in terms of the proviso(a) to Section 34, the Court shall call upon the person, who is tendering the said document to pay duty and ten times penalty and thereafter admit the document in evidence. If duty and penalty is not paid, the document shall not be admitted in evidence.<strong></strong>

<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong><sup>**Corrosponding to Sec. 36, Indian Stamp Act</sup></strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="has-small-font-size">It has nothing to do with impounding the document. A duty is cast upon every judge to examine every document that is sought to be marked in evidence. The nomenclature of the document is not decisive. The question of admissibility will have to be decided by reading the document and deciding its nature and classification. Even while recording ex parte evidence or while recording evidence in the absence of the Counsel for the other side, the Court should be vigilant and examine and ascertain the nature of the document proposed to be marked and ensure that it is a document which is admissible. <strong>The Court should not depend on objections of the other Counsel </strong>before considering whether the document is admissible in evidence or not. Section 33 of the <strong>Stamp Act casts a duty on the Court to examine the document</strong> to find out whether it is duly stamped or not, irrespective of the fact whether an objection to its marking is raised or not.””</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><u>Should Court Sit Silent </u><span style="text-decoration: underline">and Question Unstamped Documents Afterwards</span></strong></p>
<p>Though Smt. Savithramma R.C v. M/s. Vijaya Bank (supra) clarified the position with great clarity. As shown above, it pointed out-</p>

<p>Therefore, it is not definite-</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>whether the court should be unfailingly diligent enough not to mark an unstamped or insufficiently stamped document,or</li>
<li>whether the court should sit silent and mark the document if it is not opposed, or</li>
<li>whether the court should raise its eye-brows after marking it unopposed.</li>
</ul>
<p>It is yet to be solved after considering all relevant aspects.</p>
<p>Referring Sec. 36 of the (Indian) Stamp Act, Karnataka High Court pointed out in Nanda Behera v. Akhsaya Kumar Behera, 2017AIR (CC) 1893, relying on Javer Chand v. Pukhraj Surana, AIR 1961 SC 1655, and Yellapu Uma Maheswari v. Buddha Jagadheeswara Rao, (2015) 16 SCC 787, as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li class="has-small-font-size">“12. Thus where a question as to the admissibility of a document is raised on the ground that it has not been stamped or has not been properly stamped, it has to be decided then and there when the document is tendered in evidence. Once the Court, rightly or wrongly, decides to admit the document in evidence, <span style="text-decoration: underline">so far as the parties are concerned, the matter is closed.</span> Parties to a litigation, where such a controversy is raised, have to be circumspect and the party challenging the admissibility of the document has to be alert to see that the document is not admitted in evidence by the Court. The Court has to judicially determine the matter as soon as the document is tendered in evidence and before it is marked as an exhibit. Once a document has been admitted in evidence, it is not open either to the trial court itself or to a Court of Appeal or revision to go behind that order. Such an order is not one of those judicial orders which are liable to be reviewed or revised by the same Court or a Court of superior jurisdiction. An unregistered document can be relied upon for collateral purpose i.e. severancy of title, nature of possession of various shares but not for the primary purpose i.e. division of joint properties by metes and bounds. An unstamped instrument is not admissible in evidence even for collateral purpose, until the same is impounded. <span style="text-decoration: underline">If the petitioner wants to mark the documents for collateral purpose, it is open to him to pay the stamp duty together with penalty</span> and get the document impounded. Thereafter the trial court shall consider the same for collateral purpose subject to proof and relevance.”</li>
</ul>
<p>In <strong>Omprakash v. Laxminarayan</strong>, (2014) 1 SCC 618, the Apex Court observed as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li class="has-small-font-size">“From a plain reading of the aforesaid provision (S. 35 of the Stamp Act), it is evident that <span style="text-decoration: underline">an authority to receive evidence shall not admit any instrument unless it is duly stamped</span>. An instrument not duly stamped shall be admitted in evidence on payment of the duty with which the same is chargeable or in the case of an instrument insufficiently stamped, of the amount required to make up such duty together with penalty. As we have observed earlier, the deed of agreement having been insufficiently stamped, the same was inadmissible in evidence. The court being an authority to receive a document in evidence to give effect thereto, the agreement to sell with possession is an instrument which requires payment of the stamp duty applicable to a deed of conveyance. Duty as required, has not been paid and, hence, the trial court rightly held the same to be inadmissible in evidence.” </li>
</ul>
<p>The Apex Court upheld the observation of the MP High Court in Writ Petition No. 6464 of 2008, overruling the impugned judgment (Laxminarayan v. Omprakash 2008 (2) MPLJ 416). The MP High Court had observed as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li class="has-small-font-size">“8. A document would be admissible on basis of the recitals made in the document and not on basis of the pleadings raised by the parties. ….</li>
<li class="has-small-font-size">9. It would be trite to say that if in a document certain recitals are made then the Court would decide the admissibility of the document on the strength of such recitals and not otherwise. In a given case, if there is an absolute unregistered sale deed and the parties say that the same is not required to be registered then <strong>we don’t think that the Court would be entitled to admit the document because simply the parties say so. </strong>The jurisdiction of the Court flows from Sec. 33, 35 and 38 of the Indian Stamp Act and the Court has to decide the question of admissibility. With all humility at our command we overrule the judgment in the matter of Laxminarayan (supra).”</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">Is ‘Impounding’ totally Independent from ‘Admissibility’</span></strong></p>
<p>Karnataka High Court (N. Kumar, J.), in Rekha S. Chandru v. Chikka Venkatappa (2015), authoritatively held relying on Javer Chand v. Pukhraj Surana, AIR 1961 SC 1655, that when a document was already marked by the trial Court in evidence, the objection regarding stamp duty cannot be raised at a later stage. It further observed (obiter) that the impounding the document was totally different from admissibility; and therefore, an insufficiently stamped document, if admitted by mistake, was liable to be impounded by the Court and the procedure prescribed in the Stamp Act was to be followed in so far as collection of stamp duty and penalty were concerned.</p>
<p><strong>Should an opportunity be given to cure defect, by paying deficit Stamp Duty?</strong></p>
<p>In Kalaivani @ Devasena v. J. Ramu, 2010(1) CTC 27,  it was held that an opportunity should be given to the party who produces the document with insufficient stamp, to pay the deficit stamp duty and penalty so that the document could be exhibited; and that if penalty is not paid, the document should be impounded. It is held as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“24. .. It is well settled that even an unregistered document is admissible in evidence for collateral purpose provided it is adequately stamped under the Stamp act. If the document is both unstamped and unregistered, as the document in question here, it is no doubt true that it cannot be looked into for collateral purpose also. But such a document should not be thrown out at the threshold itself and an opportunity must be extended to the party who wants to mark the document on his side by directing him to pay the deficit stamp duty along with the penalty upto date, then the document could be admitted in evidence for collateral purpose. If the person does not pay the Court, then the document is to be impounded and sent to the Collector for taking action under the law.”</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><u>Upshot</u></strong></p>
<p>Inasmuch as (a) mere marking of a document <strong><em>on admission </em></strong>will not (invariably), amount to proof, or evidence of the contents of the document or its truth; (b) the <strong><em>probative value</em></strong> of a document ‘marked without objection’ may be <em>low or nil,</em> for want of proper proof; and (c) there is a formal defect to the document for it is a secondary evidence because it is produced without adducing ‘foundational evidence’, it is legitimate to say that before taking an adverse stance as to proof in this count, the court should give an opportunity to the party who relies on the document to cure the deficiency.</p>
