<p><strong><u>Introduction.  </u></strong></p>
<p>Sec. 65A and 65B of the Evidence Act are the new enabling provisions introduced to confer a right to a party who wishes to rely upon the contents of an ‘electronic record’ by ‘computer output’ (copy or print – derived from original), adopting the procedure/drill given in Sec. 65B ‘<em>without further proof or production of the original’; </em>that is, without accounting for (original) ‘electronic record’. It is to simplify the proceedings and procedures.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration:underline">Landmark Decisions</span></strong></p>
<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li>State (NCT of Delhi) v. Navjot Sandhu, (2005) 11 SCC 600,  two- judge bench decision. It is held:
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“Irrespective of the compliance with the requirements of Section 65B, which is a provision dealing with admissibility of electronic records, there is <span style="text-decoration:underline">no bar to adducing secondary evidence</span> under the other provisions of the Evidence Act, namely, <span style="text-decoration:underline">Sections 63 and 65</span>. It may be that the certificate containing the details in sub-section (4) of Section 65-B is 26 not filed in the instant case, but that does not mean that secondary evidence cannot be given even if the law permits such evidence to be given in the circumstances mentioned in the relevant provisions, namely, Sections 63 and 65.”</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Anvar PV v. PK Basheer, (2014-10 SCC 473), <strong>three- judge</strong> bench decision. It is held:
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“<span style="text-decoration:underline">That </span>(Sections 65A &amp; 65B) <span style="text-decoration:underline">is a complete code in itself.</span> Being a special law, the <span style="text-decoration:underline">general law under Sections 63 and 65 has to yield</span>.”</li>
<li>But finally held: “It is clarified that notwithstanding what we have stated herein in the preceding paragraphs on the secondary evidence of electronic record with reference to Sections 59, 65A and 65B of the Evidence Act, if an electronic record <span style="text-decoration:underline">as such is used as primary evidence under Section 62</span> of the Evidence Act, the same is admissible in evidence, without compliance with the conditions in Section 65-B of the Evidence Act.”</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Tomaso Bruno v. State of UP, (2015-7 SCC 178), <strong>three-bench</strong> decision.
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>It is held, as to make CCTV footage admissible, as under:
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“<span style="text-decoration:underline">Secondary evidence </span>of contents of document<span style="text-decoration:underline"> can <strong>also</strong> be led under Section 65</span> of the Evidence Act”.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Sonu v. State of Haryana (2017-8 SCC 570) two- judge bench decision.  It is held:
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li> “The crucial test, as affirmed by this Court, is whether the defect could have been cured at the stage of marking the document. Applying this test to the present case, <span style="text-decoration:underline">if an objection was taken</span> <span style="text-decoration:underline">to the CDRs being marked without a certificate</span>, the <span style="text-decoration:underline">court could have given</span> the prosecution<span style="text-decoration:underline"> an opportunity to rectify</span> the deficiency.”</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Shafhi Muhammed v. State of HP, (2018-2 SCC 801 )  two- judge bench decision. Tomaso Bruno (2015) was followed in.  It was held as under:
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“(11) The applicability of procedural requirement under Section 65B(4) of the Evidence Act of furnishing certificate is to be applied only when such electronic evidence is produced by a person who is in a position to produce such certificate being in control of the said device and not of the opposite party. <span style="text-decoration:underline">In a case where electronic evidence is produced by a party who is not in possession of a device, applicability of Sections 63 and 65 of the Evidence Act cannot be held to be excluded</span>. In such case, procedure under the said Sections can certainly be invoked. If this is not so permitted, it will be denial of justice to the person who is in possession of authentic evidence/witness but on account of manner of proving, such document is kept out of consideration by the court in absence of certificate under Section 65B(4) of the Evidence Act, which party producing cannot possibly secure. Thus, requirement of certificate under Section 65B(h) [sic-65B(4)] is not always mandatory. </li>
<li>(12) Accordingly, <span style="text-decoration:underline">we clarify the legal position</span> on the subject on the admissibility of the electronic evidence, <span style="text-decoration:underline">especially by a party who is not in possession of device</span> from which the document is produced. Such party cannot be required to produce certificate under Section 65B(4) of the Evidence Act. The applicability of requirement of <span style="text-decoration:underline">certificate being procedural can be relaxed</span> by Court wherever interest of justice so justifies.”</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Arjun Panditrao v. Kailash Kushanrao, (2020)3 SCC 216, <strong>three-judge </strong>bench decision. It substantially followed PV Anwar (2014) with a ‘clarification’.
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Because it is held in Anver PV v. PK Basheer that <strong><span style="text-decoration:underline">Section 62</span></strong>, 63 and 65 are <span style="text-decoration:underline">not applied</span> for electronic evidence – for 65A &amp; B are ‘complete code’ – the further observation that ‘if an electronic record <span style="text-decoration:underline">as such is used as primary evidence <strong>under Section 62</strong></span>’ stood incongruent and contradictory.  Therefore, it is “clarified” and directed to “read” Anver “without the words – ‘under Section 62 of the Evidence Act’  ”.</li>
<li>In Arjun Panditrao v. Kailash Kushanrao it is found – Tomaso Bruno v. State of UP is per-incurium as under:
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“What is clear from this judgment is that the judgment of Anvar P.V. (supra) was not referred to at all. In fact, the judgment in State v. Navjot Sandhu (2005) 11 SCC 600 was adverted to, which was a judgment specifically overruled by Anvar P.V. (supra). It may also be stated that Section 65B(4) was also not at all adverted to by this judgment. Hence, the declaration of law in <span style="text-decoration:underline">Tomaso Bruno </span>(supra) following Navjot Sandhu (supra) that secondary evidence of the contents of a document can also be led under Section 65 of the Evidence Act to make CCTV footage admissible would be in the teeth of Anvar P.V., (supra) and <span style="text-decoration:underline">cannot be said to be a correct statement of the law</span>. The said view is accordingly <span style="text-decoration:underline">overruled</span>.”</li>

<p><strong><u>‘Note: 1</u></strong>’: <strong> <span style="text-decoration:underline"><span class="uppercase">Why the Non-obstante Clause </span></span></strong></p>
<p>Sec. 65B speaks: ‘Notwithstanding anything contained in the Act .. .. the <em>computer output</em> shall be <em><u>deemed</u></em> to be <em><u><strong>ALSO</strong></u></em> a document’ (if the conditions laid down are fulfilled). It is clear:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Sec. 65B is an enabling provision. The non-obstante clause is introduced not to exclude Sec. 62 and 65.  (Contra view in Arjun Panditrao).</li>
<li>It declares ‘<em>computer output’</em> (<em>derived from original</em> or copy) <em><strong>ALSO</strong></em> as an (original) document by the deeming provision.</li>
<li>Section 65A and 65B deal with evidence ‘derived from original’ (computer output) alone; and not about original (electronic record).</li>
<li>From Sec. 65A and 65B it is clear that its application is ‘notwithstanding anything contained in the Act’, and the application of Sec. 62 to 65 are not curtailed; and, therefore, copy or computer outputs (derived from original ) can be used under Sec. 65 (Sec. 65 provides for adducing secondary evidence if the original is lost, not easily movable etc.); that is, otherwise than by producing the ‘Certificate’ under Sec. 65B(4).</li>
</ul>
<p>It is correctly held in State (NCT of Delhi) v. Navjot Sandhu,  (2005) 11 SCC 600, as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“Irrespective of the compliance with the requirements of Section 65B, which is a provision dealing with admissibility of electronic records, there is no bar to adducing secondary evidence under the other provisions of the Evidence Act, namely, Sections 63 and 65.</li>
</ul>
<p>Sec. 65A and 65B do not bar proving <strong>(i) </strong>(original) ‘electronic records’ under Sec. 62 and <strong>(ii) </strong>computer outputs (derived  from original ) under Sec. 65 (Sec. 65 provides for adducing secondary evidence if the original is lost, not easily movable etc.).  From Sec. 65A and 65B it is clear that Sec. 62 to 65 are independent from Sec. 65B (‘notwithstanding anything contained in the Act’); and, therefore, </p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Sec. 62 to 65 can also be invoked to prove ‘computer output’ (secondary evidence of the ‘electronic record’). That is, otherwise than by producing the Certificate under Sec. 65B(4). (Contra view in Arjun Panditrao).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><u>‘Note: 2</u></strong>’: Assume, the competent person gives a ‘statement’ that he cannot vouchsafe as to the truth and veracity of the document, then what will be the next step? Or, what will be the position if that person gives a false statement with respect to the document (though he knows it to be true and genuine)? Further, if the circumstances or admission by the parties show it is a genuine copy and the competent person pretends ignorance as to the truth of the document, how it will be dealt with? </p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>In all these circumstances, the ultimate way-out is to apply the principle accepted by by Tomaso Bruno v. State of UP (and followed in Shafhi Muhammed – the overruled decision).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration:underline">Does the duo by Sec. 65A &amp; 65B Evid. Act Oust the Operation of Sec. 63 &amp; 65?</span></strong></p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>That is, whether ‘computer output’ (secondary evidence of the ‘ electronic record’) can be proved only by Sec. 65B and it Constitute a ‘Complete Code’?</li>
</ul>
<p>The Answer is <strong>No.</strong> </p>
<p><span style="text-decoration:underline">Then, what does the non-obstante clause (‘Notwithstanding anything’) denote</span>? It is clear that Sec.62 to 65 are independent from the new provisions, Sec. 65A and 65B; and Sec. 62 to 65 can also be invoked to prove ‘computer output’ (secondary evidence of the ‘electronic record’).  It is definite that the non-obstante clause (‘Notwithstanding anything contained in the Act .. .. ’) in Sec. 65B does not oust Sections 63 and 65 of the Evidence Act in proving a computer output (secondary evidence). Because:</p>
<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li>Sec. 65A is an introductory provision to Sec. 65B.</li>
<li>Sec. 65A does not control Sec. 65B.</li>
<li>Sec. 65A directs only an (enabling) method to <em>PROVE</em> (not the only one method) the <em><u>CONTENTS</u></em> of <em>electronic records</em> –  by print/copy – invoking Sec. 65B.
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>(Sec. 65A reads: The contents of <em>electronic records</em><strong> <em>may be</em></strong> <em>proved</em><strong> </strong>in accordance with the provisions of section 65B.) </li>
<li>Thus, Sec. 65B is an Enabling or Added provision; and, other enabling (existing) provisions in the Indian Evidence Act, to prove documents by secondary evidence invoking Sec. 63 and 65, are <strong>not</strong> taken away.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Sec. 65B(1), further lays down that the <em>computer output</em> (copy) shall be “<em>deemed</em> to be <em><strong><span style="text-decoration:underline">ALSO</span></strong></em>” an (original) document, if the conditions in Sec. 65B(2) are satisfied, “notwithstanding anything contained in the Act”.
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>That is, Sec. 65B, does not bar proving a print/copy (as secondary evidence) by satisfying the conditions laid down in Sec. 65, by oral evidence or affidavit, as to loss of original, original with other side and notice given, original not easily movable, etc., as the case may be.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Sec. 65B deals with ‘<em><u>ADMISSIBILITY<strong>’</strong></u></em> of ‘<em><u>computer output’</u></em> (<em>derived from original</em>) alone.  </li>
<li>The conditions in Sec. 65B(2) (such as: computer was used regularly and operating properly, information was regularly fed into in the ordinary course, etc.) have to be satisfied by oral evidence or affidavit. In case of ‘statements’ alone, it can be had by the ‘certificate’ provided under Sec. 65B(4).</li>
</ol>
<p>In short, compliance of this enabling provision is not an invariable or imperative condition precedent to the admissibility’ of ‘computer output’ (<em>secondary evidence</em>); and it does not stand in the way of proving a secondary evidence of the contents of the ‘<em>electronic record</em>’, invoking the usual method laid down in Sec. 65 read with Sec. 63 of the Evidence Act – that is, satisfying the conditions laid down in Sec. 65, by oral evidence or affidavit. (Note: Contra view in: Arjun Panditrao v. Kailash Kushanrao, (2020)3 SCC 216).</p>
<p><strong><u><span style="text-decoration:underline">‘STATEMENTS’ alone can be proved by ‘CERTIFICATE’ under Sec. 65B</span></u></strong></p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Sec. 65B(2) conditions are to be satisfied for ADMISSIBILITY; and not authenticity.  Sec. 65B(4) alone deals with authenticity; because, it is laid down that the certificate “<strong><span style="text-decoration:underline">shall be evidence</span></strong> of any(?) <strong>matter stated</strong>” therein.</li>
</ul>
<p>Sec. 65B(4) reads as under:</p>
<p class="has-small-font-size" style="line-height:0">“(4) In any proceedings where </p>

<p><strong><span style="text-decoration:underline">What is a “Statement” in Evidence Act?</span></strong></p>
<p>According to Evidence Act, ‘<em><strong>statement</strong></em>’ is – that which can be expressed in the form of ‘oral evidence’. Because, “Evidence” is defined in Sec. 3 of the Evidence Act as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“Evidence means and includes—
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>all <em><strong>statements </strong></em>which the Court permits or requires to be made before it by witnesses, in relation to matters of fact under inquiry; such <em><strong>statements</strong></em> are called oral evidence.</li>

<p>Thus it appears that the call-records of phones, bank-account-statements etc. alone can be proved as ‘statements’. The ‘statement’ referred to herein is that which can be pointed out “identifying the electronic record containing the statement and describing the manner in which it was produced” as stated in Section 65B(4)(a); and which can be ‘<strong>purporting to be signed</strong>‘, as stated in Section 65B(4)(c). And, it is clear that the ‘statement’ does not pertain to other ‘information’ like CCTV Footage, photo in a pen-drive or video in a CD. (Note – contra view in Supreme Court decisions).</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration:underline"><strong>‘Statement‘ in S. 65B(4) is the ‘STATEMENT ‘CONTAINED‘ IN THE ELECTRONIC RECORD‘and NOT that GIVEN IN COURT</strong></span></p>
<p>Now, the potential question that arises for consideration is the following:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Whether the ‘statement’ mentioned in Sec. 65B(4) is
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>(i) that given in court, to support the copy or printout, or</li>
<li>(ii) that is <span style="text-decoration:underline">contained </span>in the electronic record?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>It is beyond doubt that the ‘statement’ mentioned in Sec. 65B(4) is not the one that is given in court; but, the <strong>statement</strong> ‘<strong>CONTAINED</strong>‘ <strong>in “the electronic record“. </strong>Because:</p>
<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li>The <strong>“statement</strong>” referred to in Sec. 65B (4) is one that-
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>may be:
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“<strong>desired to</strong> <strong>give</strong>” “<strong>in evidence</strong> by virtue of this section” (Sec. 65B(4) first clause); and</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The “<strong>certificate</strong>”-
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>must be one that
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“identifying the ELECTRONIC RECORD <strong><span style="text-decoration:underline">CONTAINING</span> THE STATEMENT </strong>and describing the manner in which <strong>it </strong>was produced” [Section 65B(4)(a)].</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The above view is fortified by the following:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Sec. 65B(4) says that the certificate
<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li>must state, under Sec. 65B(4)(c), among other things, facts as to “dealing with any of the matters to which the conditions mentioned in <strong>sub-section (2)</strong> relate”
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Note: Proving matter with ’certificate’ under Sec. 65B(4) is a species and proving the conditions laid down in Sec. 65B(2) is genus.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>could be signed by a person who has
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“a responsible <strong>official</strong> <strong>position</strong> in relation to the <strong>operation of the relevant device </strong>or the management of the relevant activities” (Section 65B(4)(c).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Thus, the formal assertions like statements of witnesses, call-records of phones, bank-account-statements, etc. alone can be proved as ‘<strong>statements</strong>’, by virtue of section 65B; and not ‘<strong>information</strong>’ like CCTV Footage, photo in a pen-drive or video in a CD.</p>
<p>In short, going by Sec. 65B, it is definite that-</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>the computer-output (copy) containing the <strong>‘information’</strong> (e.g. CCTV Footage, photo or video in a CD) in the electronic-record (original) can be admitted in evidence, under Sec. 65B, if only the conditions (such as: the computer was operating properly, the electronic record is derived from such information fed into the computer in the ordinary course of the activities, etc.) mentioned in Sec. 65B(2) are satisfied (that is, the conditions are to be proved through the usual mode of oral evidence or affidavit); and</li>
<li>the ‘<strong>statements’</strong> (e.g. call-records of phones, bank-account-statements) alone can be admitted in evidence, under Sec. 65B (by computer-output, without further proof or production of the original electronic-record), through a ‘<strong>certificate</strong>‘ (Note – Contra view in Court decisions. In the binding Court decisions it is stated that sans the Certificate, no computer-output can be taken into consideration).</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="text-decoration:underline"><strong>Photo or video captured in a mobile phone, ‘trap-video’, CCTV footage</strong>, <strong>etc. cannot be used under Sec. 65B</strong>.</span></p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">

<li>(For example – Computer Account statements in a Bank.)</li>

</li>
<li>For all other computer outputs (copy of, photo or video captured in a mobile phone, ‘trap-video’, CCTV footage, etc.), one has to resort other provisions of the Evidence Act, by producing the original or by producing the copy after satisfying the circumstances under Sec. 65.

<p>‘<strong><u>Computer output’</u> <span style="text-decoration:underline">can be got produced by ‘any computer‘ and no evidence/certificate required</span></strong></p>
<p>A ‘Computer Output’ can be got copied or printed by ‘<mark class="has-inline-color has-primary-color" style="background-color:rgba(0,0,0,0)">any</mark> computer’. It need not be the part of the device that was “used regularly to store or process information”.

<p><span style="text-decoration:underline"><strong>Presumption on ‘<u>Computer output’</u> </strong>(print or copy)</span></p>
<p>From the very wordings in Sec. 65B(5)(c), the ‘proof’ (through witnesses or certificate) as to the involvement of the computer which (finally) produced the computer output (print or copy) need <strong>not</strong> be furnished. Because, the legislature contemplated a presumption as to correctness of the computer output (not truth of contents), under Sec. 65B(5)(c), as it reads:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>‘a computer output <mark class="has-inline-color has-primary-color" style="background-color:rgba(0,0,0,0)"><em><span style="text-decoration:underline">shall be </span><span style="text-decoration:underline">taken to have been</span></em></mark> produced by<span style="text-decoration:underline"> <strong><mark class="has-inline-color has-primary-color" style="background-color:rgba(0,0,0,0)">a</mark> </strong></span>computer whether it was produced by it directly or (<span style="text-decoration:underline">with or without human intervention</span>) by means of any appropriate equipment’.</li>
</ul>
<p>It is similar to Sec. 63 clause (2) which reads as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“Copies made from the original by <span style="text-decoration:underline">mechanical processes</span> <span style="text-decoration:underline">which in</span> <span style="text-decoration:underline">themselves</span> insure the accuracy of the copy …. …”</li>
</ul>
<p>Sec. 63 lays down the sorts of secondary evidence accepted by the Evidence Act. It is seen that Sec. 65B(5)(c) expressly says also as to presumption on correctness, as stated above.</p>
<p><strong><u>Mere marking– not dispense with proof</u></strong> <strong>(of truth of contents)</strong></p>
<p>In <strong>Sait Tarajee Khimchand v. Yelamarti Satyam</strong>, AIR 1971 SC 1865, the Supreme Court observed that mere marking of a documents (day book and ledger) as exhibits do not dispense with the proof of documents. In <strong>Nandkishore Lalbhai Mehta Vs. New Era Fabrics</strong>, AIR 2015 SC 3796, it is observed that mere marking as exhibit and identification of executor’s signature by one of witnesses does not prove contents of a document.</p>
<p>In <strong><em>Kaliya Vs. State of Madhya Pradesh</em></strong><em> (</em>2013-10 SCC 758) it is held as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“Mere admission of a document in evidence does not amount to its proof. Nor, mere marking of exhibit on a document does not dispense with its proof, which is otherwise required to be done in accordance with law. (Vide: The Roman Catholic Mission Vs. The State, AIR 1966 SC 1457; Marwari Khumhar Vs. Bhagwanpuri Guru Ganeshpuri AIR 2000 SC 2629; RVE Venkatachala Gounder Vs. Arulmigu AIR 2003 SC 4548; Smt. Dayamathi Bai Vs. K.M. Shaffi, AIR 2004 SC 4082; and LIC of India  Vs. Rampal Singh Bisen,2010-4 SCC 491).”</li>
<li>“The court is obliged to examine the <strong>probative value</strong> of documents produced in court or their contents and decide the question of admissibility of a document in secondary evidence.”</li>
<li>[Note: Further held: “In case, an objection is not raised at that point of time, it is precluded from being raised at a belated stage.”]</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><em>IF the TRUTH is IN ISSUE</em> </strong>mere proof of handwriting or execution not evidence of truth:   <em>IF the TRUTH of the facts stated in a document is IN ISSUE</em> mere proof of the hand-writing and execution of the document would not furnish evidence of the truth of the facts or contents of the document.</p>
<p>In <strong>Ramji Dayawala Vs. Invest Import</strong>: AIR 1981 SC 2085, it us held as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“If the truth of the facts stated in a document is in issue mere proof of the handwriting and execution of the document would not furnish evidence of the truth of the facts or contents of the document. The truth or otherwise of the facts or contents so stated would have to be proved by admissible evidence, i.e. by the evidence of those persons who can vouchsafe for the truth of the facts in issue.”</li>
</ul>
<p>If ‘truth’ is in issue, or in dispute, <em>marking without objection </em>by itself does not absolve the duty to prove the truth as to the contents of the documents.

<p>If the conditions mentioned in this Section Sec. 65B(2) are satisfied, by necessary implication, it will bring a presumption under Sec. 114 with respect to regularity of the computer output .

<p>The requirement in Sec. 65B(2) as to ‘proof’ (through witnesses or certificate) for ‘regularity‘ of feeding information into the computer in the ‘ordinary course‘ eloquently support this proposition.</p>

<p><strong><u>Presumption of Fact Means Truth/Correctness of Fact</u></strong></p>
<p>St. of West Bengal Vs. Mir Mohammad Omar (AIR 2000 SC 2988) it is held by our Apex Court as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><em>“Presumption of fact is an inference as to the existence of one fact from the existence of some other facts, unless the<strong><span style="text-decoration:underline"> truth</span></strong> of such inference is disproved. Presumption of fact is a rule in law of evidence that a fact otherwise doubtful may be inferred from certain other proved facts. When inferring the existence of a fact from other set of proved facts, the Court exercises a process of reasoning and reach a logical conclusion as the most probable position. The above principle has gained legislative recognition in India when Section 114 is incorporated in the Evidence Act. It empowers the Court to presume the existence of any fact which it thinks likely to have happened. In that process Court shall have regard to the common course of natural events, human conduct etc. in relation to the facts of the case.”</em></li>

<p class="has-background-background-color has-background">As shown by Justice V. Ramasubramanian in <em>Arjun Panditrao v. Kailash Kushanrao, </em>Sec. 65B is a substantial reproduction of Sec. 5 of the UK Civil Evidence Act, 1968, and that it is introduced in India 10 years after it was repealed in UK. No doubt, it will stand as a masterly provision, if it aids simplification of procedure and leads to attain ends of justice. Even if any deflection in any corner, the judicial wisdom of the Apex Court will guide the courts in India through correct path.</p>
<p>The present UK Act (Civil Evidence Act 1995) does not make any special provision for Electronic Evidence or Computerised Records. It deals this matter under the head ‘hearsay evidence’ and makes ‘safeguards’ with respect to the hearsay evidence.</p>

<p class="has-small-font-size"><strong><u>What is ‘certificate’, in law</u></strong></p>
<ul class="has-small-font-size wp-block-list">
<li>The <span style="text-decoration:underline">usual</span> method to prove documents is by giving oral evidence or furnishing affidavit.  A certificate, in most cases, is an opinion, and prepared on the basis of other documents or evidences. In such cases, when it is an assumption or inference, it by itself, is not admissible, as it will only be, at the most, a secondary evidence. A Wound Certificate is not a substantive evidence. It has to be proved by a competent witness. If presumption cannot be invoked under Clause (e) of Sec. 114 Evidence Act (that judicial and official acts have been regularly performed), no certificate or report can be taken as proved unless its contents are proved in a formal manner. (This is why Order XXVI rule 10 CPC specifically says – Commission Report shall ‘form part of the record’.)</li>
<li>Our Apex Court held in Dharmarajan v. Valliammal, 2008 (2) SCC 741, that ‘a certificate issued by the Tahsildar cannot be relied on without examining the Tahsildar who issued the same’. It is referred to in Pankajakshan Nair v. Shylaja, ILR 2017-1 Ker 951.</li>

<ol class="has-small-font-size wp-block-list">
<li><strong>State (NCT of Delhi) v. Navjot Sandhu</strong>, (2005) 11 SCC 600,  <strong>two- judge bench</strong> decision. It is held:
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“Irrespective of the compliance with the requirements of Section 65B, which is a provision dealing with admissibility of electronic records, there is <span style="text-decoration:underline">no bar to adducing secondary evidence</span> under the other provisions of the Evidence Act, namely, <span style="text-decoration:underline">Sections 63 and 65</span>. It may be that the certificate containing the details in sub-section (4) of Section 65-B is 26 not filed in the instant case, but that does not mean that secondary evidence cannot be given even if the law permits such evidence to be given in the circumstances mentioned in the relevant provisions, namely, Sections 63 and 65.”</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Anvar PV v. PK Basheer</strong>, (2014-10 SCC 473), <strong>three- judge</strong> bench decision. It is held:
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“<span style="text-decoration:underline">That </span>(Sections 65A &amp; 65B) <span style="text-decoration:underline">is a complete code in itself.</span> Being a special law, the <span style="text-decoration:underline">general law under Sections 63 and 65 has to yield</span>.”</li>
<li>But finally held: “It is clarified that notwithstanding what we have stated herein in the preceding paragraphs on the secondary evidence of electronic record with reference to Sections 59, 65A and 65B of the Evidence Act, if an <span style="text-decoration:underline">electronic record as such is used as primary evidence under Section 62</span> of the Evidence Act, <span style="text-decoration:underline">the same is admissible in evidence</span>, without compliance with the conditions in Section 65B of the Evidence Act.”</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Tomaso Bruno v. State of UP, </strong>(2015-7 SCC 178), <strong>three-bench</strong> decision.
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>It is held, as to make CCTV footage admissible, as under: </li>
<li>“<span style="text-decoration:underline">Secondary evidence </span>of contents of document<span style="text-decoration:underline"> can <strong>also</strong> be led under Section 65</span> of the Evidence Act”.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Sonu v. State of Haryana</strong> (2017-8 SCC 570): <strong>two- judge bench</strong> decision.  It is held:
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“The crucial test, as affirmed by this Court, is whether the defect could have been cured at the stage of marking the document. Applying this test to the present case, <span style="text-decoration:underline"><strong>if an objection </strong>was taken</span> <span style="text-decoration:underline">to the CDRs being marked without a certificate</span>, the <span style="text-decoration:underline">court could have given</span> the prosecution<span style="text-decoration:underline"> an <strong>opportunity to rectify</strong></span> the deficiency.”</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Shafhi Muhammed v. State of HP,</strong> (2018-2 SCC 801 ), <strong>two- judge</strong> bench decision. Tomaso Bruno (2015) was followed in. It was held as under:
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“(11) The applicability of procedural requirement under Section 65B(4) of the Evidence Act of furnishing certificate is to be applied only when such electronic evidence is produced by a person who is in a position to produce such certificate being in control of the said device and not of the opposite party. <span style="text-decoration:underline">In a case where electronic evidence is produced by a party who is not in possession of a device, applicability of Sections 63 and 65 of the Evidence Act cannot be held to be excluded</span>. In such case, procedure under the said Sections can certainly be invoked. If this is not so permitted, it will be denial of justice to the person who is in possession of authentic evidence/witness but on account of manner of proving, such document is kept out of consideration by the court in absence of certificate under Section 65B(4) of the Evidence Act, which party producing cannot possibly secure. Thus, requirement of certificate under Section 65B(h) [sic-65B(4)] is not always mandatory. </li>
<li>(12) Accordingly, <span style="text-decoration:underline">we clarify the legal position</span> on the subject on the admissibility of the electronic evidence, <span style="text-decoration:underline">especially by a party who is not in possession of device</span> from which the document is produced. Such party cannot be required to produce certificate under Section 65B(4) of the Evidence Act. The applicability of requirement of <span style="text-decoration:underline">certificate being procedural can be relaxed</span> by Court wherever interest of justice so justifies.”</li>
</ul>

<li><strong>Arjun Panditrao v. Kailash Kushanrao, </strong>(2020)3 SCC 216, <strong>three-judge </strong>bench decision. It substantially followed PV Anwar (2014) with a ‘clarification’.
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Because it is held in Anver PV v. PK Basheer that <strong><span style="text-decoration:underline">Section 62</span></strong>, 63 and 65 are <span style="text-decoration:underline">not applied</span> for electronic evidence – for 65A &amp; B are ‘complete code’ – the further observation that ‘if an electronic record <span style="text-decoration:underline">as such is used as primary evidence <strong>under Section 62</strong></span>’ stood incongruent and contradictory.  Therefore, it is “clarified” and directed to “read” Anver “without the words – ‘under Section 62 of the Evidence Act’  ”.</li>
<li>In Arjun Panditrao v. Kailash Kushanrao it is found – Tomaso Bruno v. State of UP is per-incurium as under:</li>
<li>“What is clear from this judgment (Tomaso Bruno) is that the judgment of Anvar P. V. (supra) was not referred to at all. In fact, the judgment in State v. Navjot Sandhu (2005) 11 SCC 600 was adverted to, which was a judgment specifically overruled by Anvar P. V. (supra). It may also be stated that Section 65B(4) was also not at all adverted to by this judgment. Hence, the declaration of law in <span style="text-decoration:underline">Tomaso Bruno </span>(supra) following Navjot Sandhu (supra) that secondary evidence of the contents of a document can also be led under Section 65 of the Evidence Act to make CCTV footage admissible would be in the teeth of Anvar P. V., (supra) and <span style="text-decoration:underline">cannot be said to be a correct statement of the law</span>. The said view is accordingly <span style="text-decoration:underline">overruled</span>.”</li>
