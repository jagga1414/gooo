<p>Order II rule 2 of the Code of Civil Procedure bars splitting of reliefs, claimed in suits, on the same cause of action. The object is two-fold. First, defendants should not be vexed twice for the same cause of action (Inacio Martins v. Narayan Hari Naik, AIR 1993 SC 1756; 1993-3 SCC 123; and the second, prevent multiplicity of suits (State Bank of India v. Gracure Pharmaceuticals Ltd. ,  AIR 2014 SC 731; R. Salvi v. Satish Shankar Gupte, AIR 2004 Bom 455).</p>
<p><strong>“<span style="text-decoration:underline">Order II rule 2 : Suits to include the whole claim:</span></strong></p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>(1) Every suit shall include the whole of the claim which the plaintiff is entitled to make in respect of the cause of action; but a plaintiff may relinquish any portion of his claim in order to bring the suit within the jurisdiction of any Court.</li>
<li>(2) <span style="text-decoration:underline">Relinquishment of part of claim</span>.- Where a plaintiff omits to sue in respect of, or intentionally relinquishes, any portion of his claim, he shall not afterwards sue in respect of the portion so omitted or relinquished.</li>
<li>(3) <span style="text-decoration:underline">Omission to sue for one of several reliefs</span>.- A person entitled to more than one relief in respect of the same cause of action may sue for all or any of such reliefs; but if he omits, except with the leave of the Court, to sue for all such reliefs, he shall not afterwards sue for any relief so omitted.</li>
<li>Explanation.- For the purposes of this rule an obligation and a collateral security for its performance and successive claims arising under the same obligation shall be deemed respectively to constitute but one cause of action.”</li>
