<p>SECTION 4 of the Indian Easements Act defines Easements as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“An easement is a<em> <strong><u>right</u></strong></em></li>
<li>which the owner or occupier of certain land possesses,
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>as such,</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>for the beneficial enjoyment of <em>that land</em> </li>
<li>to do and continue to do something, or to prevent and continue to prevent something being done,</li>
<li>in or upon, or in respect of, certain other land <em>not his own</em>.”</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><u><strong><u>Acquisition of Easements –  “Basis of Every Right of Easement is  Grant”</u></strong></u></strong></p>
<p>The Indian Easements Act, 1882 refers to the different methods by which easements are acquired. They are pointed out (<strong>Ramkanya Bai v. Jagdish</strong>, AIR 2011 SC 3258) to be the following:</p>
<ol class="wp-block-list" style="list-style-type:1">
<li>easements by grant: <strong>express grant</strong> by the owner of the servient heritage</li>
<li>easements of necessity: based on <strong>implied grants</strong> or reservations made by the owner of a servient heritage at the time of transfers or partitions</li>
<li>easements by prescription: it is <strong>presumed</strong> that it is acquired by peaceable and open enjoyment, without interruption for twenty years and</li>
<li>customary easements: it is <strong>inferred</strong> that it is acquired by virtue of a local custom.</li>
</ol>
<p>For easement by prescription, it is not necessary that the user should be exclusive, but the claimant should exercise it under some claim existing in his own favour independently of all others.</p>
<p>The origin of all easements is, theoretically, grant by the servient owner. It may be express or implied. It may also be presumed from long user. It is observed in <strong>Sree Swayam Prakash Ashramam v. G. Anandavally Amma</strong>, AIR 2010 SC 622, as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“Theoretically all easements have their origin in some sort of grant by the servient owner. The grant may be <span style="text-decoration:underline">express </span>or it may be <span style="text-decoration:underline">implied </span>from the surrounding attendant circumstances and conduct of the parties or it may even be <span style="text-decoration:underline">presumed</span> from long user. In the case of an express grant of easement the limit thereof depends on the words used.”</li>
</ul>
<p>In Lachhi v. Ghansara Singh, AIR 1972 HP 89, it is held as under:</p>
<p>The basis of every right of easement is theoretically a ‘grant’ from the servient-owner.</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>It may be <strong>expressed</strong>, as in <strong>Sections 8 to 12</strong> of the Act; or</li>
<li>it may be <strong>implied</strong> from the circumstances as in<strong> Section 13 </strong>of the Act; or</li>
<li>it may be <strong>presumed</strong> from long and continued user for a certain period as in <strong>Section 15</strong> of the Act; or</li>
<li>it may be <strong>inferred </strong>from a long and continued practice of user by a certain class of the public in certain locality.</li>
</ul>
<p>For easement by prescription, it is not necessary that the user should be exclusive, but the claimant should exercise it under some claim existing in his own favour independently of all others.</p>

<p>Sec. 12, Easements Act states that an easement is acquired by the owner of an immovable property. It is observed by the Apex Court in <strong>Bachhaj Nahar Vs. Nilima Mandal</strong>, AIR 2009 SC 1103, that the claimant of easement (by prescription) should plead and prove that the right claimed was enjoyed <span style="text-decoration: underline">independent of any agreement</span> with the owner of the property over which the right is claimed, as any user with the express permission of the owner will be a licence and not an easement. </p>

<p><strong><u><mark class="has-inline-color has-primary-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Adverse Possession</mark> – ‘Evolving’ Concept</u></strong></p>
<p>Adverse possession being essentially a judge-made law, and not exhaustively defined in any statute, the concept of adverse possession has been ‘evolving’. It is interesting to note that there were divergent views even with respect to the very fundamentals of ‘adverse possession’.</p>
<p><strong><u>Earlier view</u> –</strong> Inaction of true-owner matters (not overt-acts of trespasser) </p>
<p>At one time it was considered that inaction/acquiescence of the <em>true owner </em>for 12 years brings-in adverse possession. Because,</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Article 65, which speaks of as to limitation of suits (to be filed by the plaintiffs) does not specifically speak as to (i)  intention to dispossess title owner or (ii) knowledge on the part of trespasser as to who is the true owner.</li>
<li>“Nec vi, nec clam, nec precario” does not refer to (or speak as to) ‘hostile’ possession</li>
<li>“Animus possidendi” also does not say – hostile possession.</li>
<li>Inaction, acquiescence etc. of true owner are the material considerations – to become a ‘possession’ adverse to plaintiff.</li>
<li>Therefore, to attract adverse possession the trespasser need not know the true owner.</li>
</ul>
<p>Philosophy of the earlier view can be seen from Amrendra Pratap Singh v. Tej Behadur (Para 22 – <strong>AIR 2004 SC 3782</strong>)</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“What is adverse possession? ………The process of acquisition of title by adverse possession <em>springs into action essentially<strong> by default or inaction of the owner</strong></em>. ……… The law does <strong><em>not intend to confer any premium</em></strong> on the wrong doing of a person in wrongful possession; it pronounces the penalty of extinction of title on the person who though entitled to assert his right and remove the wrong doer and re-enter into possession, has <em>defaulted and remained inactive</em> for a period of 12 years, which the law considers reasonable for attracting the said penalty. ………..”</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><u>Present view</u> –</strong> Give prominence to overt and adverse acts of trespasser. </p>
<p>Following are the important decisions to see the present view on adverse possession:</p>
<ol class="wp-block-list" start="1" style="list-style-type:1">
<li>Karnataka Board of Wakaf v. Govt of India, AIR 2004 SC 2096</li>
<li>T. Anjanappa v. Somalingappa, (2006) 7 SCC 570]</li>
<li>PT Munichikkanna Reddy v. Revamma, AIR 2007 SC 1753</li>
<li>Ravinder Kaur Grewal v. Manjit Kaur,AIR 2019 SC 3827: (2019) 8 SCC 729</li>
</ol>
<p>PT Munichikkanna Reddy v. Revamma, AIR 2007 SC 1753, is the latest decision of the Supreme Court that discussed various views on adverse possession. It is observed in this decision as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“Adverse possession in one sense is based on the theory or presumption that the owner has abandoned<sup>#</sup>* the property to the adverse possessor on the acquiescence of the owner to the hostile acts and claims of the person in possession. It follows that sound qualities of a typical adverse possession lie in it being open, continuous and hostile.”
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><sup>#</sup>*<strong><sup>See Blog: <a href="https://indianlawlive.net/2022/11/09/does-abandonment-give-rise-to-an-indestructible-right-in-indian-law/">Does ‘Abandonment’ Give rise to a Recognised Right in Indian Law?</a></sup></strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>“<em>Thus, there must be <strong>intention to dispossess</strong>. And it needs to be <strong>open</strong> and <strong>hostile enough</strong> to bring the same <strong>to the knowledge</strong> and plaintiff has an<strong> opportunity to object</strong>.</em>“</li>
</ul>
<p>Thereafter it was emphasised as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“Therefore, to assess a claim of adverse possession, two-pronged enquiry is required:</li>
<li>1. Application of limitation provision thereby jurisprudentially “willful neglect” element on part of the owner established. Successful application in this regard distances the title of the land from the paper-owner.</li>
<li>2. Specific Positive intention to dispossess on the part of the adverse possessor effectively shifts the title already distanced from the paper owner, to the adverse possessor. Right thereby accrues in favour of adverse possessor as intent to dispossess is an express statement of urgency and intention in the upkeep of the property.”</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Read Blog: </strong><a href="https://indianlawlive.net/2021/03/11/adverse-possession-an-evolving-concept/"><strong>Adverse Possession: An Evolving Concept</strong></a></p>
<p>U.N. Mitra, in the “Law of Limitation and Prescription” (Tagore Law Lectures – 12th Edition, Vol.2, Page 1430) it is stated as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“A squatter is one who settles on land without title or with a view to acquiring title. He is a person who settles or locate on land enclosed or unenclosed with no bona fide claim or colour of title and without consent of the owner. He is merely an intruder and no matter how long he may continue there, no right in law vests in him. <span style="text-decoration: underline">A squatter</span> who <span style="text-decoration: underline">does not set up a claim of right cannot plead adverse possession</span>. No length of squatting possession would operate as a good or valid defence in a suit for possession by the true owner. A mere squatter or intruder who does not deny the title of the true owner or set up any right in himself cannot claim to be in adverse possession. ………” (Quoted in: K.J. Abraham v. Mrs. Mariamma Itty, ILR 2016-3 Ker 98)</li>
</ul>
<p>In a nutshell, adverse possession arises from:</p>
<ol class="wp-block-list" start="1" style="list-style-type:1">
<li>acquiescence of the owner to the hostile acts; and</li>
<li>hostile acts of the trespasser.</li>

<p><strong><u>Prescriptive Rights – Inchoate until the title is upheld by a competent court</u></strong></p>
<p>No doubt, it is true, one can acquire right of easement or adverse possession by prescription. But, prescriptive rights are said to be <strong><u>inchoate </u></strong>(started; but, not full-blown) until the such title is declared or upheld by a competent court.</p>
<p>It was observed in Sultan Ahmad v. Valiullah (1912) 10 ALJ 227, that the result of the Easements Act and the similar provisions of the Limitation Act was that a right of easement could not be said to be perfected until the right was declared by a decree of court.</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Sultan Ahmad v. Valiullah (1912) 10 ALJ 227 is referred to in:</li>
<li>Nachiparayan v. Narayana Goundan, (1920): 60 Ind Cas 171, (1920) 39 MLJ 574;</li>
<li>Arjuna Udayar v. Manuswamy Naicker, 1999-1 CurCC 97.</li>
<li>See also: Tradesh and Miners, Ltd v. Dhirendra Nath Banerjee, AIR 1944 Pat 261.</li>
</ul>
<p>In Siti Kantapal v. Radha Gobindaen, AIR 1929 Cal 542, it was held as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“It has been authoritatively held that a tie to easement is not complete merely upon the effluxion of the period mentioned in the Statute viz., 20 years and that however long the period of actual enjoyment may be, no absolute or indefeasible right can be acquired until the right is brought in question in some suit, and until it is so brought in question, the right is <strong><u>inchoate only </u></strong>and in order to establish it when brought in question, the enjoyment relied on, must be an enjoyment for 20 years up to within 2 years of the institution of the suit.” (Quoted in – <strong>D. Ramanatha Gupta vs S. Razaack</strong>, AIR 1982 Kant 314.)</li>
</ul>
<p>In Ramanunni Vaidyar v. Govindankutty Nair, 1998(2) Ker LT 47, it is found that a person who has not acquired or perfected a right cannot maintain an action against the owner of the land over which the right is claimed. It is held as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>In my view, on the basis of an <strong><u>inchoate right</u></strong> or a right which has not ripened into an easement by prescription, but is merely one of user, no relief can be granted to the user of them as against the owner of that land. In other words, a right, properietory or otherwise, has to be shown for obtaining relief (Krishna Pillai v.Kunju Pillai 1990 (1) KLT 136, referred to).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><u>S. 27,  Lim. Act Gives Substantive Right – One Can Seek Declaration and Recovery</u></strong></p>
<p>Generally speaking, the Limitation Act only bars the remedy but doesn’t destroy the right to which the remedy relates to. The exception to the general rule is contained in Section 27 of the Limitation Act, 1963.</p>
<p>Sec. 27 of the Limitation Act speaks that at the determination of the period “hereby limited to any person for instituting a suit for possession of any property”, his right to such property shall be extinguished.</p>
<p>The Limitation Act is an Act of repose. “Adverse possession statutes, like other statutes of limitation, rest on a public policy that do not promote litigation and aim at the repose of conditions that the parties have suffered to remain unquestioned long enough to indicate their acquiescence.” (See: PT Munichikkanna Reddy and others v. Revamma, (2007) 6 SCC 59: AIR 2007 SC 1753)</p>
<p>Adverse possession confers title under Sec. 27 (by necessary implication, because extinguished title of real owner comes to vest in wrongdoer – because, rights thereon had already been lost to the true owner, and passed over to the ‘possessory/adverse’ owner).</p>
<p>Therefore it is clear that Sec. 27 is a provision in the Limitation Act that gives a substantial right to a party. In view of Sec. 27 one can seek declaration of title by adverse possession and consequential injunction or recovery. That is why it is held in Ravinder Kaur Grewal v. Manjit Kaur,  AIR 2019 SC 3827: (2019) 8 SCC 729, that the person acquiring title by adverse possession can use it as a sword.</p>
<p><strong><u>Plea of <mark class="has-inline-color has-primary-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">title and adverse possession</mark></u> – <u>Whether Mutually Contradictory</u></strong>?</p>
<p>In Government of Kerala v. Joseph, AIR 2023 SC 3988, it is held as under: </p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“21.9 Claim of independent title and adverse possession at the same time amount to <strong><u>contradictory pleas</u></strong>. The case of Annasaheb Bapusaheb Patil v. Balwant, (1995) 2 SCC 543 elaborated this principle as:</li>
<li>“15. Where possession can be referred to a lawful title, it will not be considered to be adverse. The reason being that a person whose possession can be referred to a lawful title <strong><u>will not be permitted to show</u></strong> that his possession was hostile to another’s title. One who holds possession on behalf of another, does not by mere denial of that other’s title make his possession adverse so as to give himself the benefit of the statute of limitation. Therefore, a person who enters into possession having a lawful title, cannot divest another of that title by pretending that he had no title at all.”</li>
<li>This principle was upheld in the case of Mohan Lal v. Mirza Abdul Gaffar (AIR 1996 SC 910, 1996 1 SCC 639 – two Judge Bench) –</li>
<li>“4. As regards the first plea, it is <strong><u>inconsistent</u></strong> with the second plea. Having come into possession under the agreement, he must disclaim his right thereunder and plead and prove assertion of his independent hostile adverse possession <strong><u>to the knowledge of the transferor</u></strong> or his successor in title or interest and that the latter had acquiesced to his illegal possession during the entire period of 12 years, i.e., up to completing the period of his title by prescription nec vi, nec clam, nec precario. Since the appellant’s claim is founded on Section 53-A, it goes without saying that he admits by implication that he came into possession of the land lawfully under the agreement and continued to remain in possession till date of the suit. Thereby the plea of adverse possession is not available to the appellant.”</li>
<li>The Court in Uttam Chand (Sri Uttam Chand v.  Nathu Ram AIR 2020 SC 461) has reiterated this principle of adverse possession.”</li>
</ul>
<p>(Note: Mutually destructive plea is impermissible: (2006) 12  SCC 233, AIR 2009 SC 2355).</p>
<p><strong><u>Is declaration necessary for claiming <mark class="has-inline-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#1b16f3">Easement</mark>?</u></strong></p>
<p><strong>No.</strong></p>
<p>Sec. 35 Easement Act allows to file a suit if the easement is disturbed (without making ground thereof by establishing the right by a ‘declaration’). See: Unnikrishnan v. Ponnu Ammal: AIR 1999 Ker 405.</p>
<p>Sec. 35 Easement Act reads as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">

<li>Asserted title or civil right is <strong><u>not </u></strong>clear, simple and <strong>straight-forward</strong>; or, not<strong> well-established</strong> (lawful possession). Make clear what is <strong>doubtful</strong> – as to legal character and title. ILR 1970-2 (Del) 433: Eg. Suit by trespasser claiming adverse possession: Darshan Kumari v.

<li>In Sudhakara Reddy v. Lakshmamma, 2014 (4) ALT 404, 2011 (4) ALD 325 (DB), the High Court found fault with the lower courts for framing an issue so as to embrace a declaration (as to cancellation of a deed) in the suit seeking injunction simpliciter.</li>

<p><strong><u>Should Date of Beginning of 20 Years be pleaded?</u></strong></p>
<p>In Justiniano Antao v. Bernadette B. Pereira, (2005) 1 SCC 471, it was pointed out as follows:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“In order to establish a right by way of prescription to the detriment of the other party, one has to show that the incumbent has been using the land as of right peacefully and openly and without any interruption for the last 20 years. There should be specific pleadings and categorical evidence in general and specifically that since what date to which date one is using the access for the last 20 years.”</li>
</ul>
<p>Kerala High Court, in Soman Nair v. Manoj Kumar, 2014 (P. Bhavadasan, J.) distinguished the decision Justiniano Antao v. Bernadette B. Pereira, observing as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“12. A reading of the decision reported in Justiniano Antao’s case (cited supra) would reveal that the dictum has to be read in the context of facts of the case. That was a case where the Apex Court found that till 1984, the claimant was using another way and only thereafter the claim over the way through servient tenement was made. A vague assertion had been made in the said case that the pathway has been used for a long time. It was under those circumstances, the Apex Court had occasion to hold as mentioned above.</li>
<li>13. In the case on hand, the definite pleading as could be culled out from the written statement and counter claim is that defendants as well as their predecessors-in-interest have been using the pathway in question for a long time in fact for more than 30 years and this is only means of access  to their property.”</li>
</ul>
<p>Pappachan v. Alex, ILR 2023-3 Ker 523; 2023-5 KHC 10, distinguished the decision Justiniano Antao v. Bernadette B. Pereira, observing as under: </p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“24. In Justiniano Antao (supra) there was no pleading by the plaintiff that she used the pathway in question for a period of 20 years. Holding that in the absence of such a pleading which is elementary and essential to claim a prescriptive easement right, the Apex Court held that the date from which the right of way was started to use should have been pleaded. The pleadings set forth by the appellants in this case certainly constitute sufficient pleadings to claim easement by prescription. It is true that they did not plead as to from which date they started using that pathway. They, however, pleaded that for the last more than 35 years they have been using that pathway. In the light of such a specific pleadings the law laid down in Justiniano Antao [(2005) 1 SCC 471] does not disentitle the appellants from claiming the relief.”</li>
