<p><strong><u>Cancellation of Sale Deeds and Settlement Deeds</u></strong></p>
<p>Section 31 of the Specific Relief Act provides for cancellation of deeds by the civil court. The grant of such a decree is discretionary.  The court can adjudge an instrument void or voidable, partially or completely. To attract Sec. 31-</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>(i) The instrument in question must be a written one.</li>
<li>(ii) It must be a void or voidable one as against the plaintiff.</li>
<li>(iii) The plaintiff must have reasonable apprehension that such instrument, if left outstanding, may cause him serious injury.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><u>Cancellation</u></strong><strong><u> can be equated to Rescission in Contract</u></strong></p>
<p>A deed of cancellation amounts to rescission of contract. (In contractual matters the term recession is used to denote cancellation.) If it is viewed in the light of Section 62 of the Indian Contract Act, the cancellation (being a recession) must be done bilaterally.</p>
<p><strong><u>Who can seek Cancellation</u></strong></p>
<p>Section 31 makes it clear – one can seek Cancellation if –</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>the written instrument stands against his interest</li>
<li>the instrument is void or voidable (or void so far as that person is concerned)</li>
<li>he has a  reasonable apprehension that the instrument, if left outstanding may cause serious injury to him.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><u>When can a Stranger Seek Cancellation</u></strong></p>
<p>Section 31 does not give a right to a stranger to the document to sue for cancellation. But, a stranger can seek a declaration as to the instrument (e.g., it is not binding on him on the ground that it casts cloud upon his title), and even consequential relief for cancellation, in a proper case.</p>
<p><strong><u>When one is NOT PARTY to Document, No Need to Annul by Cancellation</u></strong></p>
<p>It is held in Y. G. Gurukul v. Y. Subrahmanyam, AIR 1957 AP 955, as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“When a person is not eo-nomine a party to a suit or a document, it is unnecessary for him to have the deed or the decree <strong>annulled,</strong> and he can proceed on the assumption that there was no such document or decree. (Followed in Sankaran v. Velukutty, 1986 Ker LT 794.)</li>
</ul>
<p>In <strong>Usman Kurikkal v. Parappur Achuthan Nair</strong>, ILR 2012-3 Ker 343; 2012 3 KHC 89, it is held as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">Plaintiff is neither a party</span></strong> to the sale deed nor a party to the resolution empowering the Board to execute the sale deed. The prayer in the plaint is essentially for a <span style="text-decoration: underline">declaration that the sale deed is not valid and binding</span> on the plaintiff. The plaintiff has not sought for a cancellation of the sale deed obviously because he was not an executant thereto. <span style="text-decoration: underline">The plaintiff can very well <strong><mark class="has-inline-color has-primary-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">ignore</mark></strong> the sale deed and <strong><mark class="has-inline-color has-primary-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">need not seek</mark> </strong><mark class="has-inline-color has-primary-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">its <strong>annulment</strong></mark></span> as has been held in Sankaran v.

<li>See also:  SR Suresh Babu v. Beena, 2022 KHC OnLine 196.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Supreme Court observed in V.  Kalyanaswamy v. L.  Bakthavatsalam, 2020 3 RCR(Civ) 404; 2020 9 Scale 367, as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“Plaintiffs-appellants in OS No. 36 of 1963 were <strong>not parties to the suit </strong>in 1958 and the compromise in OS No. 71 of 1958 <strong>will not bind</strong> the appellants.”</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">Incumbent for the Executant to Seek Cancellation of Sale Deeds</span></strong></p>
<p>It is held in Chellakannu v. Kolanji (R. Banumathi, J.),  AIR 2005 Mad 405, that the word <em><span style="text-decoration: underline">“Cancellation” implies that the persons suing should be a party to the document</span></em>; and that it is incumbent on the executant of the document (for avoiding its binding nature) to seek cancellation of sale deeds, and a prayer to declare the sale deeds as invalid  tantamount to cancellation; and therefore, court fee applicable to cancellation has to be paid. Our Apex Court approved this decision (Chellakannu v. Kolanji) in J. Vasanthi v. N. Ramani Kanthammal, AIR 2017 SC 3813.</p>
<p><strong><u>Cancellation of alienations in Partition Suits</u></strong></p>
<p>In Umadevi Nambiar v. Thamarasseri Roman Catholic Diocese, AIR 2022 SC 1640; 2022-7 SCC 90, it is held that in Partition of property, it is not always necessary for a plaintiff in a suit for partition to seek cancellation of alienations.</p>
<p><strong><u>Propositions as to Questioning a Deed</u></strong> <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">WHERE ONE is NOT a Party</span></strong></p>
<p>In Noorul Hoda v. Bibi Rafiunnisa, 1996 (7) SCC 767, our Apex Court held as follows:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“When the plaintiff seeks to establish his title to the property which cannot be established without avoiding the decree or an instrument that stands as an <span style="text-decoration: underline">insurmountable obstacle</span> in his way which otherwise binds him, though not a party, the plaintiff necessarily has to <span style="text-decoration: underline">seek a declaration</span> and have that decree, instrument or contract cancelled or set aside or rescinded.” </li>
</ul>
<p>In Chellakannuv. Kolanji (R. Banumathi, J.), AIR 2005 Mad 405, it is observed as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“12. The word <em><span style="text-decoration: underline">“Cancellation” implies that the persons suing should be a party to the document.</span></em> <span style="text-decoration: underline">Strangers</span> are not bound by the documents and are <span style="text-decoration: underline">not obliged to sue for cancellation</span>. When the party to the document is suing, challenging the document, he must first obtain cancellation before getting any further relief. Whether cancellation is prayed for or not or even it is impliedly sought for in substance, the suit is one for cancellation. In the present case, <span style="text-decoration: underline">when the Plaintiff attacks the Sale Deed</span>s as having been obtained from him under fraud and mis-representation the <span style="text-decoration: underline">Plaintiff cannot seek for any further relief without setting aside the Sale Deeds</span>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Where one person is <span style="text-decoration: underline">not a party to a deed</span>, following propositions can be laid down:</p>
<ol class="wp-block-list" style="list-style-type:1">
<li>Where a deed is ‘<strong><u>null and wholly void</u></strong>‘ (e.g., unregistered sale/gift), he can simply avoid the deed and advance with other reliefs.
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Limitation statute will have no application in such cases.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If it is <strong><u>not</u></strong> ‘null and wholly void‘, he cannot simply avoid the deed and advance with other reliefs.
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>But, in such cases, it is not mandatory to seek ‘annulment’ of the deed – by ‘setting it aside’ or ‘cancelling it’.</li>
<li>It will be sufficient – to resort to “appropriate proceeding”, for avoiding the same, before a court of law, seeking proper declaration or otherwise.</li>
<li>It must be done within the limitation period prescribed.</li>
<li>In such cases the plaintiff need not pay Court Fee for ‘cancellation’ of a deed; it will be sufficient to pay the fee for ‘declaration’.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong><u>Partial or Complete Cancellation </u></strong></p>
<p>In a proper case it may be possible to cancel a part of the document. But, if it is an indivisible agreement such bifurcation is not possible. It is held in Laxmanlal K. Pandit v. Mulshankar Pitambardas, (1908) 10 BomLR 553 7, as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“Finally, it was urged that even if part of the consideration for the rent note failed, yet part of it should be held not to fail, and to the extent of the part held good relief should be allowed to the plaintiff in this suit. It is, however, clear to us that the agreement was an indivisible agreement. Part of a single consideration for one object was unlawful, and therefore the whole agreement is void under Section 24 of the Contract Act. As was said by Mr. Justice Chitty in Baker v. Hedgecock (1888) 39 Ch. D. 520 it is not possible for the Court to “create or carve out a new covenant for the sake of validating an instrument which would otherwise be void.” The suit is a suit for rent, and is based upon a rent note which is void.”</li>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Person aggrieved by a Cancellation deed has to seek relief in Civil Court</strong></span></p>
<p>Full Bench of Andhra High Court, in Yanala Malleswari v. Ananthula Sayamma, 2006 (6) ALT 523: 2007 (1) CTC 97,  held that an if a person is <span style="text-decoration: underline">aggrieved by a cancellation deed, the remedy for hism  is to seek appropriate relief in the civil Court</span>. It was observed as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li> “26. It is a misconception that in every situation, a person who suffers injury by reason of a document can file a suit for cancellation of such written instrument. Two conditions must exist before one invokes Section 31 of Specific Relief Act. These are: the written instrument is void or voidable against such person; and such person must have reasonable apprehension that such instrument if left outstanding may cause him serious injury.</li>
<li>Insofar as Section 34 of the Specific Relief Act is concerned, it is no doubt true that a person entitled to any right as to any property can seek declaration that he is so entitled to such right. Here again, the person who claims the right to property can institute a declaration suit only when the defendant denies or interested to deny the title of the plaintiff.</li>
<li>The difference between the two situations is glaring. In one case, cancellation of deed can be sought in a Court only by a person who executed document and who perceives that such document is void or voidable. In the other case, even if a person is not a party to the document, he can maintain a suit for declaration.”</li>
</ul>
<p>It was also observed as to questioning a cancellation deed as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“We, therefore, hold that <span style="text-decoration: underline">whenever a person is aggrieved by a cancellation deed, the remedy is to seek appropriate relief in the civil Court</span> and writ petition is not proper remedy.”</li>

</ul>
<p>In Sudhakar Reddy v. Lakshmamma, 2014 (4) ALT 404, 2011 (4) ALD 325 (DB), the High Court after quoting the aforesaid passage from Yanala Malleswari v. Ananthula Sayamma, it was held as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“15. In view of the principle enunciated in the case cited supra, the finding of the trial Court that the <span style="text-decoration: underline">Ex.B1 gift deed executed in favour of the defendant was cancelled is not sustainable. The only remedy available to the donor is to file a suit for cancellation of Ex.B1 gift deed</span>, as provided Section 31 of the Specific Relief Act.”</li>
</ul>
<p>In Sudhakara Reddy v. Lakshmamma, (supra), the High Court found fault with the lower courts for framing an issue so as to embrace a declaration. The High Court held as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“The plaintiff filed the suit seeking injunction simpliciter. In such circumstances, the <span style="text-decoration: underline">trial Court ought not to have framed the issue, which is in the nature of a declaration</span>. The trial Court decreed the suit basing on oral evidence of PWs.1 to 3 and also on a wrong premise that Ex.B.1 gift deed was cancelled by late Gowramma, during her life time.”</li>
</ul>
<p>The Andhra High Court held in KV Sudha Rani v. Vijayawada, Guntu, Tenali, Mangalagiri UDA, 2008(4) ALD 545, on an analysis of the provisions of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882, and the Registration Act, 1908, that when once the sale deed is executed, the title in the property passes to the purchaser forthwith. The person who seeks cancellation of the registered document has two remedies available to him under law, namely (1) to seek invalidation under Section 31 of the Specific Relief Act, and (2) to seek cancellation  following rule 26(k)(i) of the Rules framed by the State of Andhra Pradesh.</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Note: Similar provision that of rule 26(k)(i) of the AP Rules is not in all other States.</li>
</ul>
<p>It was further held that except those two remedies, <span style="text-decoration: underline">no person or authority has the right to unilaterally invalidate a registered document</span> on any ground. (Followed in: Hayagreeva Farms and Developers, Visakhapatnam, v. Govt. of AP, 2014 (3) ALT 3 : 2014 (2) ALD 250.)</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Unilateral Cancellation of a <mark class="has-inline-color has-primary-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Sale Deed</mark> Bad in Law</strong></span></p>
<p>Unilateral cancellation of a deed of sale is bad (Full Bench in Latif Estate Line India Ltd. v. Hadeeja Ammal, AIR 2011 Mad 66; Latif Estate Line India Ltd. Vs Hadeeja Ammal, AIR 2011 Mad 66;  KV Sudha Rani v. Vijayawada, Guntu, Tenali, Mangalagiri UDA, 2008(4) ALD 545).  Such a  cancellation deed cannot be accepted for registration. </p>
<p>Our Apex Court analysed the Madras decision in Latif Estate Line India Ltd. v. Hadeeja Ammal, in the following words in <strong>Asset Reconstruction Company v. SP Velayutham (2022) 8 SCC 210</strong>:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“41. The Full Bench decision of the Madras High Court in Latif Estate Line India Ltd. Vs Hadeeja Ammal, AIR 2011 Mad 66,  arose out of a controversy as to whether a deed of cancellation of sale can or cannot be accepted for registration. The Full Bench explained the circumstances under which a deed of cancellation, presented by both the vendor and the purchaser, can be accepted. But the Full Bench categorically held that a deed of <span style="text-decoration: underline">unilateral cancellation cannot even be accepted for registration</span>. </li>
<li>This proposition actually goes in support of the contention of the appellant that the <span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Registering Officer has a duty to see</strong> whether the document presented for registration has been <strong>presented in accordance with law</strong> or not.</span> In fact the decision of the Full Bench itself arose out of a writ petition challenging the act of the Registering Authority in allowing the registration of the deeds of unilateral cancellation of sale deeds.”</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">Cancellation of a deed on the Ground, ‘Fraud’</span></strong></p>
<p>Satya Pal Anand v. State of Madhya Pradesh,  (2016) 10 SCC 767, is an authority on the following mayyers:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline">Some irregularity</span>, by itself, <span style="text-decoration: underline">cannot result in a fraudulent action</span> of the State Authority;</li>
<li>Allegations relating to ‘fraud’ are <span style="text-decoration: underline">questions of fact which must be pleaded and proved</span>.</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline">An aggrieved</span> person  by registration of a (fraudulent) document is <span style="text-decoration: underline">free to challenge</span> its validity <span style="text-decoration: underline">before the civil court</span>.</li>
</ul>
<p>It is held as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“36. If the document is required to be compulsorily registered, but while doing so <span style="text-decoration: underline">some irregularity</span> creeps in, that, by itself, <span style="text-decoration: underline">cannot result in a fraudulent action</span> of the State Authority. <span style="text-decoration: underline">Non-presence of the other party</span> to the extinguishment deed presented by the Society before the Registering Officer <span style="text-decoration: underline">by no standard can be said to be a fraudulent action per se</span>. The fact whether that was done deceitfully to cause loss and harm to the other party to the deed, <span style="text-decoration: underline">is a question of fact which must be pleaded and proved</span> by the party making such allegation. That fact cannot be presumed. Suffice it to observe that since the provisions in the 1908 Act enables the Registering Officer to register the documents presented for registration by one party and execution thereof to be admitted or denied by the other party thereafter, it is unfathomable as to how the registration of the document by following procedure specified in the 1908 Act can be said to be fraudulent. As aforementioned, some irregularity in the procedure committed during the registration process would not lead to a fraudulent execution and registration of the document, but a case of mere irregularity. In either case, the <span style="text-decoration: underline">party aggrieved</span> by such registration of document is <span style="text-decoration: underline">free to challenge</span> its validity <span style="text-decoration: underline">before the civil court</span>.”</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">Pleadings on Cancellation of a deed on the Ground, ‘Fraud’</span></strong></p>
<p>The Supreme Court held in CS Ramaswamy v. VK Senthil, 2022 SCC OnLine SC 1330,  as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“7.8 Even the averments and <span style="text-decoration: underline">allegations in the plaint with respect to fraud</span> are <span style="text-decoration: underline">not supported by any further averments and allegations</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline">how the fraud has been committed/played</span>. Mere stating in the plaint that a fraud has been played is not enough and the allegations of fraud must be specifically averred in the plaint, otherwise merely by using the word “fraud”, the plaintiffs would try to get the suits within the limitation, which otherwise may be barred by limitation. Therefore, even if the submission on behalf of the respondents – original plaintiffs that only the averments and allegations in the plaints are required to be considered at the time of deciding the application under Order VII Rule 11 CPC is accepted, in that case also by such vague allegations with respect to the date of knowledge, the plaintiffs cannot be permitted to challenge the documents after a period of 10 years. By such a clever drafting and using the word “fraud”, the plaintiffs have tried to bring the suits within the period of limitation invoking Section 17 of the limitation Act. The plaintiffs cannot be permitted to bring the suits within the period of limitation by clever drafting, which otherwise is barred by limitation.”</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">Cancellation of a Regd. deed on Ground, ‘Undue Influence’</span></strong> <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">– Presumption</span></strong></p>
<p>In Bellachi v. Pakeeran (2009) 12 SCC 95, our Apex Court held as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“15. <span style="text-decoration: underline">Section 16 of the Indian Contract Act</span> provides for as to what constitutes <span style="text-decoration: underline">undue influence</span>. Relationship between the parties so as to enable one of them to dominate the will of the other is a sine qua non for constitution of undue influence …..</li>
<li>16. In a given case it is possible to hold that when an illiterate, pardanashin woman executes a deed of sale, the burden would be on the vendee to prove that it was the deed of sale was a genuine document. It is, however, a <span style="text-decoration: underline">registered document. It carries with it a presumption that it was executed in accordance with law.</span> Again a concurrent finding of fact has been arrived at that she was not an illiterate woman or she was incapable of understanding as to what she had done.”</li>
</ul>
<p>The Apex Court quoted the following from Afsar Sheikh v. Soleman Bibi, 1976 (2) SCC 142-:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“4. In his written statement, Afsar defendant denied the allegations of fraud and misrepresentation. He averred that his grandmother was the sister of the plaintiff’s mother. The defendant’s father died when he was an infant. The plaintiff brought him up as a son. Since his very infancy, the defendant has been living with the plaintiff, managing his affairs and treating him as his father. The defendant further stated that the plaintiff has transferred 10 to 12 bighas of land to his natural son and an equal area to his second wife. Out of love and affection, the plaintiff conferred a similar benefit on the defendant and voluntarily executed the hiba-bil-ewaz after receiving from the donee a dhoti as a symbolic consideration therefor. He denied that the plaintiff at the time of the gift was too old and infirm. According to him, the plaintiff was not more than 75 years of age. He further averred that he was in possession of the suit lands ever since the execution of the hiba.”</li>
<li>“20. It is well-settled that a <span style="text-decoration: underline">question whether a person was in a position to dominate the will of another</span> and procured a certain deed by undue influence, is a <span style="text-decoration: underline">question of fact</span>, and a finding thereon is a finding of fact, and if arrived at fairly, in accordance with the procedure prescribed. is not liable to be reopened in second appeal (Satgur Prasad v. Har Narain Das; Ladli Prasad Jaiswal v. Karnal Distillery Co. Ltd. ).” </li>

<p>In Satya Pal Anand v. State of Madhya Pradesh,  (2016) 10 SCC 767, the Apex Court did not consider whether the executants of a deed can ‘unilaterally cancel’ it. It was held-</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“It is open to the appellant to contend in those (civil court) proceedings that the Extinguishment Deed could not have been <span style="text-decoration: underline">unilaterally</span> executed by the Society.”</li>

</ul>
<p>In Asset Reconstruction Company v. SP Velayutham (2022) 8 SCC 210, the Supreme Court made the following observation as to Satya Pal Anand v. State of Madhya Pradesh,  (2016) 10 SCC 767.</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li class="has-small-font-size">42. …  The decision in <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">Satya Pal Anand v. State of Madhya Pradesh</span>,</strong> (2016) 10 SCC 767, arose out a case where the allotment of a plot made by a cooperative society was <span style="text-decoration: underline">cancelled unilaterally</span> by a deed of extinguishment, by the society. The allottee raised a dispute which ended in a compromise but notwithstanding the compromise the allottee raised a dispute under the relevant provisions of the Madhya Pradesh Cooperative Societies Act, 1960. <span style="text-decoration: underline">When the dispute was pending, the allottee moved the Registering Officer for the cancellation</span> of the deed of transfer executed in favour of the subsequent purchasers. When the <span style="text-decoration: underline">Registering Authority refused to comply with the demand, a writ petition was moved seeking a declaration</span> that the deed of extinguishment and the subsequent sales were null and void. The <span style="text-decoration: underline">High Court dismissed</span> the writ petition on the<span style="text-decoration: underline"> ground that a dispute was already pending before the competent authority</span> under the Cooperative Societies Act. When the order of dismissal passed by the High Court was challenged before this Court, there was a <span style="text-decoration: underline">difference of opinion</span> as to whether the <span style="text-decoration: underline">issue was directly covered by the decision of this Court in Thota Ganga Laxmi and Another v. Government of Andhra Pradesh</span> and Others, (2010) 15 SCC 206 . Therefore, the matter was <span style="text-decoration: underline">placed before a three Judge </span>Bench. While upholding the decision of the High Court, the <span style="text-decoration: underline">three member Bench <strong>held in Satya Pal Anand</strong> (supra) that there was </span><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">no rule in the State of Madhya Pradesh</span></strong><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong> similar to</strong> Rule 26(k)(i) of the Rules</span> issued by the <span style="text-decoration: underline">State of </span><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">Andhra Pradesh</span> </strong>under Section 69 of the Registration Act, 1908 and that therefore the decision in Thota Ganga Laxmi (supra) cannot be invoked.</li>
<li class="has-small-font-size">43. The decision in Satya Pal Anand (supra) cannot go to the rescue of the contesting respondents, for the simple reason that the writ petitioner in that case, first accepted a compromise and then raised a dispute under the Cooperative Societies Act (which is akin to a civil suit) and thereafter approached the High Court under Article 226 for a declaration, which he could have sought only in the already instituted proceedings. The very fact that <span style="text-decoration: underline">Thota Ganga Laxmi was sought to be distinguished on the basis of the express provision</span> contained in the Rules of the State of A.P., would indicate that there is no absolute bar for the High Court to exercise jurisdiction under Article 226.”</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline">Asset Reconstruction Company v. SP Velayutham, (2022) 8 SCC 210</span></p>
<p>It was a case concerning Government properties. The sale deed came for consideration in the case was executed by a Power of Attorney. The Apex Court said as to the PoA as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li class="has-small-font-size">“35. Apart from the fact that clause 7 extracted above expressly prohibited the power to encumber, there was also no stipulation authorising S.P. Velayutham to appear before any Registering Officer for the purpose of sale, as an agent.”</li>
</ul>
<p>The Apex Court upheld the authority of the Sub Registrar observing the following-</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li class="has-small-font-size">“46. But we are not concerned in this case with the question whether the PoA relied upon by the power agent S.P. Velayutham in the sale deed executed by him, required authentication and <span style="text-decoration: underline">whether the Registering Authority committed a blunder in accepting the sale deed</span> presented by him for registration, <span style="text-decoration: underline">without verifying the authentication of the PoA</span> or not. We <span style="text-decoration: underline">are concerned</span> in this case with the most<span style="text-decoration: underline"> <strong>fundamental question </strong></span>whether the <span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Registering Authority could have turned a blind eye</strong></span> to the fact that the deed of<span style="text-decoration: underline"> PoA </span>on the basis of which the sale deed was executed as well as presented for registration by S.P. Velayutham <span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>contained an express prohibition for the power agent to create an encumbrance</strong></span> on the property, especially in the light of the Rules framed under section 69 of the Act. The decision in <span style="text-decoration: underline">Thota Ganga Laxmi</span>, <span style="text-decoration: underline">was in a way approved by a 3 ­member Bench</span> in <span style="text-decoration: underline">Satya Pal Anand</span>, on the basis of the rules in the State of Andhra Pradesh, <span style="text-decoration: underline">showing thereby that statutory rules also play a crucial role</span>. Rajni Tandon is not an authority for holding that the registering Authority has no duty even to verify the presence or absence of a power of sale in the deed of PoA, especially in the light of the rules.”</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally allowing the appeal the Supreme Court held as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li class="has-small-font-size">“58. … If the Registering Officer under the Act is construed as performing only a mechanical role without any independent mind of his own, then even <span style="text-decoration: underline">Government properties may be sold </span>and the documents registered <span style="text-decoration: underline">by unscrupulous persons driving the parties to go to civil court</span>. <span style="text-decoration: underline">Such an interpretation may not advance the cause of justice</span>.”</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">Unilateral Cancellation of <u><mark class="has-inline-color has-primary-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">SETTLEMENT DEED</mark></u> When there was <mark class="has-inline-color has-primary-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">No Reservation</mark></span></strong></p>
<p>In Pavakkal Noble John v. Kerala State, 2010 (3) Ker LT 941 (upheld  in Santhosh Antonio S. Netto v. Joshy Thomas, 2020-3 Ker LT 408),  the Kerala High Court pointed out that the <span style="text-decoration: underline">Registrar must refuse to register</span> the cancellation of <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">sale deed</span></strong> <span style="text-decoration: underline">executed unilaterally.</span></p>
<p>In Sreedevi v. The Inspector General of Registration (January,  2020, Kerala High Court), it was found that there was <span style="text-decoration: underline">no reservation </span>in the <strong><u>settlement deed</u></strong> for cancellation by the executant unilaterally. Then it was pointed out as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“In such circumstances, the registration of cancellation deed is illegal. Once the subject matter of the <span style="text-decoration: underline">settlement deed</span> is conveyed to the donee, the donee becomes the absolute owner. The cancellation of a registered deed executed unilaterally will create impediment in the enjoyment of the property. No doubt, the executant of such deed is having a remedy under the Specific Relief Act to cancel such deed before the Civil Court. But they cannot execute a cancellation deed and cancel the settlement deed executed in favour of the donee.”</li>
</ul>
<p>The Kerala High Court repeated the above view in SR Suresh Babu v. Beena, 2022 KHC OnLine 196, as regards a settlement deed, in the following words:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“In the <span style="text-decoration: underline">absence of any right for revocation </span>of the deed in the deed itself, <span style="text-decoration: underline">unilateral execution of the cancellation deed</span> according to us <span style="text-decoration: underline">is bad in law </span>and is legally unsustainable.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">Cancellation of <u><mark class="has-inline-color has-primary-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">SETTLEMENT DEED </mark></u></span></strong>– <span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Cannot<span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong> be Challenged </strong></span>by Writ Petition</strong></span></p>
<p>In the decision of the Madras High Court in D. Sachidhanandam v. The Registrar/ Inspector General (2022, April), a settlement deed was cancelled by the settleor by a registered cancellation deed. It was challenged by the settlee in a writ petition. Dismissing the writ petition  the High Court held as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“The <span style="text-decoration: underline">registering authority has no power to desist from registering a document, once it is submitted to him along with the necessary documents</span>, which are mandated under the Act and once the document is properly registered, the registering authority, in the absence of any express provision under the Act or the Rules, is <span style="text-decoration: underline">not competent to cancel the registered document</span>.</li>
<li>The writ petitions, at the instance of the petitioners are wholly misconceived and the <span style="text-decoration: underline">writ jurisdiction cannot be invoked seeking cancellation</span> of the respective cancellation deeds and this Court, sitting under Article 226 of the Constitution, cannot issue a writ directing the registering authority to cancel the registered document, when it involves disputed questions of fact between the parties.  Further, the remedy open to the petitioners/aggrieved party is only to file a civil suit before the appropriate jurisdictional court and a writ petition is not maintainable.</li>

<p>In CK Saseendran v. Inspector General of Registration, 2021-6 Ker LT 382, one cancel-deed  was registered, cancelling a trust deed. The <span style="text-decoration: underline">reason for revoking</span> the trust deed stated in the cancellation deed was that the <span style="text-decoration: underline">general body</span> of the Association <span style="text-decoration: underline">did not ratify </span>the registration of the trust deed and the <span style="text-decoration: underline">general body resolved to cancel</span> the trust deed. The <span style="text-decoration: underline">legality</span> of the cancellation deed and its registration was <span style="text-decoration: underline">challenged</span> in the Writ Petition. </p>
<p>The <span style="text-decoration: underline">High Court accepted the contention of the Respondents</span> that (i) the <span style="text-decoration: underline">Registering Officer <strong>cannot enquire</strong> about the</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>legal validity</strong></span> of a document  (as per Rule 67<strong><sup>#</sup>*</strong> of the Kerala Registration Rules, 1958), and (ii) that the Registering Officer <span style="text-decoration: underline">can refuse a document  only under Rule 191</span><strong>*<sup>*</sup></strong> (read with Rule 67); and that none of such heads/ conditions existed to refuse registration of the cancellation deed.</p>
