<p>In Everest Holding Limited Vs. Shyam Kumar Shrivastava, 2008 (16) SCC 774, it is held as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“Though the JVA (<span style="text-decoration: underline">Joint Venture Agreement</span>) may have been <strong>t<u>erminated and cancelled</u></strong> as stated but it was a valid JVA containing a valid arbitration agreement for settlement of disputes arising out of or in relation to the subject matter of the JVA. <span style="text-decoration: underline">The argument</span> of the respondent that the disputes <span style="text-decoration: underline">cannot be referred to the arbitration</span> as the agreement is <strong><u>not in existence</u></strong> as of today is therefore <span style="text-decoration: underline">devoid of merit</span>.”</li>

<p>Referring Everest Holding Limited Vs. Shyam Kumar Shrivastava, 2008 (16) SCC 774, it is held in Reva Electric Car Co. Ltd v. Green Mobil, (2012) 2 SCC 93, it is held as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“Section 16(1)(a) presumes the existence of a <span style="text-decoration: underline">valid arbitration clause</span> and mandates the same to be treated as an agreement <span style="text-decoration: underline">independent</span> of the other terms of the contract. By virtue of Section 16(1)(b), it continues to be <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">enforceable notwithstanding</span></strong> a declaration of the contract being <strong><u>null and void</u></strong>.

<p>In Reliance Industries Limited v. Union of India, 2014-7 SCC 603, referring Sec. 16 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996  it is held as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“61. A bare perusal of the aforesaid would show that the arbitration agreement is <strong><u>independent of the other terms</u></strong> of the contract. Further, even if the contract is declared <strong><u>null and void</u></strong>, it would not lead to the foregone conclusion that the arbitration clause in invalid. The aforesaid provision has been considered by this Court in a number of cases, which are as follows-
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Reva Electric Car Company P. Ltd. v. Green Mobil, 2012-2 SCC 93,</li>
<li>Today Homes and Infrastructure Pvt. Ltd . v. Ludhiana Improvement Trust and Anr., 2013-7 SCALE 327,</li>

<p><strong><u>Arbitration Clause  Forms Independent Contract</u></strong></p>
<p>In Enercon (India) Ltd. v. Enercon GMBH, 2014-5 SCC 1, it is held as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>83. The concept of separability of the arbitration clause/agreement from the underlying contract is a necessity to ensure that the intention of the parties to resolve the disputes by arbitration does not evaporate into thin air with every challenge to the legality, validity, finality or breach of the underlying contract. The Indian Arbitration Act, 1996, as noticed above, under Section 16 accepts the concept that the <strong><u>main contract and the</u></strong> <strong><u>arbitration agreement form two independent contracts</u></strong>. Commercial rights and obligations are contained in the underlying, substantive, or the main contract. It is followed by a second contract, which expresses the agreement and the intention of the parties to resolve the disputes relating to the underlying contract through arbitration. A remedy is elected by parties outside the normal civil court remedy. It is true that support of the national courts would be required to ensure the success of arbitration, but this would not detract from the legitimacy or independence of the collateral arbitration agreement, even if it is contained in a contract, which is claimed to be void or voidable or unconcluded by one of the parties.” (Quoted in: Ashapura Mine -Chem Ltd.  v. Gujarat Mineral Development Corporation,  2015-8 SCC 193).</li>
</ul>
<p>Note: It is beyond doubt that the intention of Sec. 16(1) the Act is not-</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>to resurrect an arbitration clause that cannot be invoked in cases (i) where the period of limitation provided for suits is elapsed; or (ii) where there is a rescission or alteration of contract under Sec. 62 of the Contract Act, and thereby the parties need not have performed the original contract (as shown below).</li>

<li>“25. ……..It is only in those cases where the court, while dealing with Section 8 of the Act, finds that there are very serious allegations of fraud which make a virtual case of criminal offence  or where allegations of fraud are so complicated that it becomes absolutely essential that such complex issues can be decided only by the civil court on the appreciation of the voluminous evidence that needs to be produced, the court can sidetrack the agreement by dismissing the application under Section 8 and proceed with the suit on merits. It can be so done also in those cases where there are serious allegations of forgery/fabrication of documents in support of the plea of fraud or where fraud is alleged against the arbitration provision itself or is of such a nature that permeates the entire contract, including the agreement to arbitrate, meaning thereby in those cases where f<span style="text-decoration: underline">raud goes to the validity of the contract itself of the entire contract which contains the arbitration clause or the validity of the arbitration clause itself</span>…….”.

<p>It was pointed out in Zenith Drugs &amp; Allied Agencies Pvt. Ltd. v.
