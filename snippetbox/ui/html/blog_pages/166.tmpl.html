</ul>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">Introduction</span></strong></p>
<p>Proof of documents involves two things.</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>First, Proof of execution.</li>
<li>Second, Truth of its contents.</li>
</ul>
<p>For the purpose of Sec. 67, 68 and 69 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872, the proof of execution is ‘proof of signature and handwriting’. This requirement as to proof of execution is independent from the requirement as to ‘proof of truth’. </p>
<p>Sec. 67, which lays down the foundational principles as to the proof of documents, does not speak about truth of contents of the documents. Sec. 67 reads as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>67. <span style="text-decoration: underline">Proof of signature and handwriting of person alleged to have signed or written document produced</span>—If a document is alleged to be signed or to have been written wholly or in part by any person, the signature or the handwriting of so much of the document as is alleged to be in that person’s handwriting must be proved to be in his handwriting.</li>
</ul>
<p>The fundamental principles as to proof of execution a document is that the execution has to be proved by admissible evidence, that is by the ‘evidence of those persons who can vouchsafe for the truth of the facts in issue’ (Ramji Dayawala v. Invest Import: AIR 1981 SC 2085; <em>Narbada Devi Gupta v. Birendra Kumar Jaiswal, 2003-8 SCC 745).</em> But, in the facts and circumstances of each case, the court is at liberty to invoke its wisdom and fill certain gaps in evidence by applying ‘presumption’ (Indian Oxygen Limited v. IR Workmen,  AIR  1969 SC 612;  Village Panchayat Nori Madhusudan v. Nori Venkatarama Deekshithulu, 1991 Supp 2 SCC 228).</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline"><mark class="has-inline-color has-primary-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">It is </mark></span></strong><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong><mark class="has-inline-color has-primary-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">not Necessary – Witnesses must See Execution of Will</mark></strong></span></p>
<p>The attestation of a Will, under Sec. 63 of the Succession Act can be made – </p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>either by</strong></span></li>
<li>the witnesses who have “seen the testator sign or affix his mark” </li>
<li><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">or by</span></strong></li>
<li>the witnesses who have<mark class="has-inline-color has-foreground-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"> “</mark><span style="text-decoration: underline"><mark class="has-inline-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#140fea">received from the testator a personal acknowledgment</mark></span> of his signature or mark”.</li>
</ul>
<p>That is, both the attesting witnesses need not be present at the time of execution of the Will.  And, one witness need not see the other attests the Will. It is fortified by last limb of Sec. 63 Succ. Act.</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“but it shall not be necessary that more than one witness be present at the same time….”</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline">Inferences and Presumptions</span></p>
<p>Elaborate provisions are contained in the Indian Evidence Act for taking inferences and presumptions, on the basis of the facts proved. Our law permits to presume ‘truth’ and ‘due execution’ in this process. ‘Truth of contents’ and ‘due execution’ can also be inferred when a document is admitted in evidence without objection. </p>
<p>But, despite admission, proof as to ‘truth’ of contents of a document is essential, if ‘truth of contents’ is in issue, or in dispute (<strong>Ramji Dayawala Vs. Invest Import</strong>, AIR 1981 SC 2085). </p>

<p><strong><u>Modes of Proof of Documents Required By Law To Be Attested.</u></strong></p>

<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>(i) an attesting witness alive,</li>
<li>(ii) he is subject to the process of court and</li>

</ul>
<p>Sec. 69 of the Evidence Act lays down that (if attesting witnesses are <span style="text-decoration: underline">not</span> found), the will can be proved – </p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>(i) </strong>by the <mark class="has-inline-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#190edb"><span style="text-decoration: underline">evidence as to the attestation</span></mark><span style="text-decoration: underline"><mark class="has-inline-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#0d08da"> </mark><mark class="has-inline-color has-foreground-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">of one attesting witness</mark></span> – <mark class="has-inline-color has-foreground-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">that it is in his <span style="text-decoration: underline">handwriting</span>, </mark> and </li>

<li>Note: 1. As regards handwriting of attesting witness, evidence on <mark class="has-inline-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#1509e1"><span style="text-decoration: underline">attestation</span></mark> is required; but in case of the handwriting of the person executing the document, evidence on <mark class="has-inline-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#061fdd"><span style="text-decoration: underline">signature</span></mark> alone (and not execution, as such) is required. It is clear that the wordings of the Section invite more cogent and convincing evidence to <mark class="has-inline-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#1509e1"><span style="text-decoration: underline">attestation</span></mark>, than that of execution. </li>
<li>2. The words in Sec. 69 as to attestation, “<mark class="has-inline-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#1f0ce1"><span style="text-decoration: underline">in his handwriting</span></mark>“, reduces the burden on “<mark class="has-inline-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#1509e1"><span style="text-decoration: underline">attestation</span></mark>” (See: T. R. Srikantaiah Setty v. Balakrishna, ILR 1999 Kar 2953).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">Analysis of Sec. 68 and 69</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>(i)</strong> Sec. 68 requires proof of “<strong>execution</strong>” by the executant; </p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>but, under <span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec. 69</span>, “<strong>handwriting</strong>” of one witness, and that of the executant, alone need be proved (and <strong>not “execution</strong>” as such).  As noted above, the words in Sec. 69 as to attestation, “<mark class="has-inline-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#1f0ce1"><span style="text-decoration: underline">in his handwriting</span></mark>“, reduces the burden on “<mark class="has-inline-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#1509e1"><span style="text-decoration: underline">attestation</span></mark>“.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>(ii) </strong>If (at least) one attesting witnesses is alive, he has to be examined, under Sec. 68. The burden is high, when Sec. 68 is invoked – for,  “execution” has to be proved. </p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Under <span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec. 69</span>, the <strong>execution is presumed</strong> from the proof of the handwriting of the attesting witness and the executant (See: Mira Bai v. Jai Singh, AIR  1971 Raj 303). </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>(iii) </strong>Sec. 68 and 69 being provide particular modes for proving documents that require attestation, the <strong>Presumptions</strong> available on a document, by themselves, cannot be called for, for proving  them (unless Sec. 71 can be invoked, as stated below).</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">Should “Attestation of other Witnesses” be Proved by the Witness</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline">(Examined)</span></strong></p>
<p>If we go by Sec. 68,  what is required from the attesting witness (in Sec. 68) is evidence as to “execution” by the executant (alone); and not “attestation of other witnesses”. </p>
<p>Therefore, there would not be any deficiency or shortcoming for not swearing matters like “attestation of other witnesses” (in the chief examination) when the attester of a Will is called for examination in court (though they  may be points for cross examination). </p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>It is further clear from the following words in Sec. 63(c) of the Succession Act –<mark class="has-inline-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#2300db">“it shall not be necessary that more than one witness be present at the same time”</mark> (when the will is executed).</li>
</ul>
<p>It is also noteworthy that Sec. 71 allows (if <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">the</span></strong> attesting witness examined in court denies execution of the document and his ‘attestation’) to prove the ‘execution’ by adducing “other evidence”; and Sec. 71 does not require compulsory examination of other attesting witness, if any.</p>
<p><strong><u>Will Attestation– What be Proved u/s. 63(c)  Suc. Act (sans S. 68 &amp; 69 Evid. Act)</u></strong></p>
<p>As shown above, the attestation of a Will, under Sec. 63 of the Succession Act, can be  made <strong>either by</strong> the witnesses (minimum two) who have “seen the testator sign or affix his mark” <strong>or by</strong> the witnesses who have <mark class="has-inline-color has-foreground-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">“received from the testator a personal acknowledgment</mark> of his signature or mark”.  (By virtue of Sec. 68, 69 and 71, attestation by one witness alone need be proved.)</p>
<p><strong><u>Sec. 68 &amp; 69 Evid. Act are Enabling Provisions</u></strong></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline">No requirement to “Prove the <strong>Truth of Contents</strong>” of Documents – </span> It is very important to notice that Sec. 68 and 69 make it clear – there will be no requirement to specifically  “prove the truth of contents” of documents that fall under Sec. 68 and 69, Evidence Act (i.e., Will, Bond, Gift and Mortgage); and, proof of its execution alone will be sufficient. This is because the Evidence Act expressly stipulates, in Sec. 68 and 69, as to proving documents by furnishing evidence on “execution” (Sec. 68); and on “attestation”  and “signature”,  (that too by proving handwriting – Sec. 69). </p>
<p>Sec. 67, the general provision, directs that for proving a document proof of signature and handwriting of person alleged to have signed or written must be proved. No mode of proof is prescribed in Sec. 67. Therefore, the fundamental principles as to proof of execution a document apply with full vigour as regards Sec. 67; that is the execution has to be proved by admissible evidence – by the ‘evidence of those persons who can vouchsafe for the truth of the facts in issue’ (Ramji Dayawala v. Invest Import: AIR 1981 SC 2085; <em>Narbada Devi Gupta v. Birendra Kumar Jaiswal, 2003-8 SCC 745).</em></p>
<p>But, Sec. 68 and 69 water-down the full vigour and lays down an enabling  ‘mode of proof’ (with respect to documents required by law to be attested). It is a deliberate deviation from Sec. 67, as held in  Sumathi Amma v. Kunjuleskhmi Amma, 1964 Ker LT 945. It is held as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“…  It (<span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Section 67</strong></span> Evidence Act) only says that facts have to be proved, and, <strong>unlike</strong> <strong>Section 68</strong>, does <span style="text-decoration: underline">not prescribe any particular mode of proof</span>. ..”</li>
</ul>
<p>It is also a remarkable and outstanding factor that the special character as to compulsory “attestation by witnesses” is attached to the “four documents” (Will, Bond, Gift and Mortgage) with a view to “<span style="text-decoration: underline">prove the truth of contents</span>” <span style="text-decoration: underline">by primarily proving ‘attestation’</span>. It is evident that this special characteristic identity is given to these documents considering their unique and exceptional nature.</p>
<p>Further, <span style="text-decoration: underline">all the requirements in Sec. 63</span>, Succession Act are <span style="text-decoration: underline">not to be categorically proved</span> (in chief examination, by the propounder) by virtue of the enabling provisions in the Evidence Act. It is obvious – it is left for ‘presumption’; and the burden to rebut it is casted on the other side.    </p>
<p>Sec. 68 and 69 do not require –</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>(i) examination of all attesting witnesses. 
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Note:</strong> <strong>(a)</strong> A Will must have been attested by two or more witnesses; but, the evidence <span style="text-decoration: underline">of one attesting witness</span> alone need be given, even if he is hostile. </li>
<li><strong>(b)</strong> Non examination of other attesting witnesses will not call for adverse inference also, if the will is (sufficiently) proved otherwise.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>(ii) evidence that each witness has seen the testator sign or affix his mark; or has received from the testator a personal acknowledgment of his signature or mark. 
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Note:</strong> <strong>(a)</strong> It must be so; but, it need not be proved, positively through the attesting witness examined.  </li>
<li><strong>(b)</strong> It can be a point for cross-examination of the concerned witnesses (by the other side), to disprove proper attestation.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>(iii) evidence that each of the witnesses have signed the will in the presence of the testator. 
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Note:</strong> <strong>(a)</strong> It must also be so; but, it need not be positively proved.  </li>
<li><strong>(b)</strong> It can also be a point for cross-examination of the concerned witnesses, to disprove proper attestation.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<p>If all legal formalities are complied with and when <span style="text-decoration: underline">ex-facie free from suspicion</span>, and the evidence required under Sec. 68 or 69 is furnished, the law permits the court <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">to presume</span></strong> that that the Will has been <span style="text-decoration: underline">signed or written by the person</span> whose signatures it bear or in whose handwriting it purports to be.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">Onus on propounder discharged when essential facts just indicated</span></strong></p>
<p>Our Apex Court in H. Venkatachala Iyengar v. B. N. ThimmajammaAIR 1959 SC 443 emphasided that the onus on the propounder of a Will could be taken to be discharged ‘on proof of the essential facts just indicated’.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Under Sec. 69, “Handwriting”, Not ‘Attestation’ or ‘Execution’, to be Proved</strong></span></p>
<p>Under Sec. 69, “handwriting” of one witness, and that of the executant, alone need be proved; and not “execution” of the executant or ‘attestation’, as such. As noted above, the words in Sec. 69 as to attestation, “<mark class="has-inline-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#1f0ce1"><span style="text-decoration: underline">in his handwriting</span></mark>“, reduces the burden on “<mark class="has-inline-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#1509e1"><span style="text-decoration: underline">attestation</span></mark>” (See: Selvasubramaniam v. Subburathinam, 2015-4 Mad LJ 452; V. Kalyanaswamy v. L. Bakthavatsalam, 2020-9 Scale 367). </p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Presumption play a great role – Execution Presumed from Handwriting</strong></span></p>
<p>It is clear that <span style="text-decoration: underline">presumption play a great role</span> in Sec. 69. That is, under Sec. 69, the execution is presumed from the proof of the handwriting of the attesting witness and the executant.  </p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline">Witness can be cross examined to negate the presumption</span></p>
<p>This presumption being a rebuttable one, and when the burden is shifted to others (Babu Singh v. Ram Sahai alias Ram Singh,  2008-14 SCC 754), they have to rebut the presumption, and can cross examine the witness to negate the presumption. </p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">Why great weight to Presumption of due execution and Truth for Will</span></strong></p>
<p>In ‘Laws of Will in India and Pakistan’, by Mantha Ramamurthi, it is said:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“If a <span style="text-decoration: underline">will appears on the face of it to have been <strong>duly executed</strong></span> <span style="text-decoration: underline">and attested</span> in accordance with the requirements of the Act, the maxim “omni a proe sumuntur rite esse acta,” applies, unless it is clearly proved by the attesting witnesses that the Will is not in fact duly executed. The <span style="text-decoration: underline">Court of Probate has long been accustomed to <strong>give great weight to the presumption</strong> of due execution</span> arising from the regularity <span style="text-decoration: underline">ex facie</span> of the testamentary paper produced where <span style="text-decoration: underline">no suspicion of fraud</span> has occurred.”</li>
</ul>
<p>After quoting above passage, it is observed in Lalitaben Jayantilal Popat v. Pragnaben Jamnadas Kataria, (2008) 15 SCC 365 as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“The maxim ‘omni a Proe sumuntur rite esse acta’ is an expression in a short form, of a reasonable probability, and of the propriety in point of law on acting on such probability. The maxim expresses an inference which may reasonably be drawn when an intention to do some formal act is established. In Blake v. Knight Sir Herbert Jenner Fusty observed – I<span style="text-decoration: underline">s it absolutely necessary</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline">to have positive affirmative testimony</span> by the subscribed witnesses that the <span style="text-decoration: underline">Will was actually signed in their presence</span>, or actually acknowledged in their presence? Is it absolutely necessary, under all circumstances that the witnesses should concur in stating that these acts took place? Or is it absolutely necessary, where the witnesses will not swear positively, that the Court should pronounce against the validity of the will. I think <mark class="has-inline-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#0912e0"><span style="text-decoration: underline">these are not absolute requisites to the validity of the will.</span> </mark>Consequently, “where the evidence of attesting witnesses is vague or doubtful or even conflicting the Court may take into consideration the circumstances of the case and judge from them collectively whether the requirements of the Statute were complied with; in other words the Court may, on consideration of other evidence or of the whole circumstances of the case, come to the conclusion that their recollection is at fault, that their evidence is of a suspicious character, or that they were wilfully misleading the Court, and accordingly disregard their testimony and pronounce in favour of the will.” </li>
<li>(Note: This decision finally accepted the view  – ‘Where one attesting witness is examined and he fails to prove the attestation of the will by the other witness there will be <span style="text-decoration: underline">deficiency</span> in meeting the mandatory requirements of Section 68 of the Evidence Act’.)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><u><mark class="has-inline-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#2e08f5">Witnesses to the Will Need Not See the Execution of the Will</mark></u></strong></p>
<p>If the Will, already executed by the testator (author of the will), is produced before one witnesses and the testator gives “a personal acknowledgment of his signature or mark” (put upon the will) and on that basis the witness attests the Will; and then the testator approaches the second witness and gets the Will attested (by the second witness also) in the same manner, such attestations are also valid and sufficient under Sec. 63(c).</p>
<p>In <strong>Ganesan v. Kalanjiam</strong>, (2020)11 SCC 715, the Supreme Court of India (Ashok Bhushan, Naveen Sinha, JJ.) held as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“The <strong>acknowledgement</strong> may assume the form of express words or conduct or both, provided they unequivocally prove an acknowledgement on part of the testator. <span style="text-decoration: underline">Where a <strong>testator</strong> <strong>asks a person to attest his Will</strong>, it is a reasonable inference that he was admitting that the Will had been executed by him</span>.</li>
<li>“There is <strong><u><mark class="has-inline-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#a217e6">no express prescription</mark></u></strong> in the statute that the <strong>testator must necessarily sign the will </strong><mark class="has-inline-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#9926e5"><strong>in presence of the attesting witnesses</strong> </mark>only or that the <strong>two attesting witnesses must put their signatures on the will simultaneously</strong> at the same time in presence of each other and the testator.”</li>

</ul>
<p>In Vikrant Kapila Vs. Pankaja Panda, 2023-6 ALT 37 (SC), it is observed as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“26. …. It is useful to refer to Gopal Swaroop v. Krishna Murari Mangal, (2010) 14 SCC 266, wherein this Court held that as per the provisions of Sec. 63 of the Indian Succession Act, 1925, the due execution of the Will consists of the following:</li>
<li>i. The testator should sign or affix his mark to the Will;</li>
<li>ii. The testator’s signature or the mark of the testator should be so placed that it should appear that it was intended to give effect to the writing as a Will;</li>
<li>iii. Two or more witnesses should attest the Will;</li>
<li>iv. Each of the said witnesses <strong><u>must have seen the testator signing</u></strong> or affixing his mark to the Will, and each of them should sign the Will in the presence of the testator.</li>
</ul>
<p>In Savithri v. Karthyayani Amma, (2007) 11 SCC 621, Supreme Court has held as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“17. … A will like any other document is to be proved in terms of the provisions of the Succession Act and the Evidence Act. The onus of proving the will is on the propounder. The testamentary capacity of the testator must also be established. Execution of the will by the testator has to be proved. At least one attesting witness is required to be examined for the purpose of proving the execution of the will. It is required to be shown that the will has been signed by the testator with his free will and that at the relevant time he was in sound disposing state of mind and understood the nature and effect of the disposition. It is also required to be established that he <strong><u>has signed the will in the presence of two witnesses</u></strong> who attested his signature in his presence or in the presence of each other. Only when there exists suspicious circumstances, the onus would be on the propounder to explain them to the satisfaction of the court before it can be accepted as genuine.”(Quoted in:  Vikrant Kapila Vs.

</ul>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">Should Attestation by “Both” Witnesses</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline">be Proved </span></strong></p>
<p>As stated above, if we go by <strong>Ganesan v.

<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">Onus on propounder discharged when essential facts just indicated</span></strong></p>
<p>Our Apex Court in H. Venkatachala Iyengar v. B. N. Thimmajamma, AIR 1959 SC 443, emphasided that the onus on the propounder of a Will could be taken to be discharged ‘on proof of the essential facts just indicated’.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">Burden to Prove Coercion, Undue Influence or Fraud on him who alleges it </span></strong></p>
<p>Who has the ‘burden of proof’ when a will is resisted with the allegation of coercion, undue influence or fraud? How to deal with such a situation? It is considered in V. Kalyanaswamy v. L. Bakthavatsalam, 2020-9 Scale 367.</p>
<p>In V. Kalyanaswamy v. L. Bakthavatsalam, the Supreme Court held as under: </p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“83. Lastly, while the burden to prove the will and to satisfy the conscience of the court that there are no suspicious circumstances or if there are any to explain them is on the propounder of the will, the burden to prove that the will is procured by coercion, undue influence or fraud is on the respondents who have alleged the same.”</li>
</ul>
<p>It is made clear-</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>The burden to prove that the will is free from suspicious circumstances is on the propounder.</li>
<li>If there are suspicious circumstances to explain,  the propounder has to explain them.</li>
<li>(However), if the respondent alleges that the will is procured by coercion, undue influence or fraud, the burden to prove such allegations is on the respondents.</li>
</ul>
<p>In Niranjan Umeshchandra Joshi v. Mrudula Jyoti Rao, 2006 (14) SCALE 186,</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“The burden of proof that the Will has been validly executed and is a genuine document is on the propounder. The propounder is also required to prove that the testator has signed the Will and that he had put his signature out of his own free will having a sound disposition of mind and understood the nature and effect thereof. If sufficient evidence in this behalf is brought on record, the onus of the propounder may be held to have been discharged. But, the onus would be on the applicant to remove the suspicion by leading sufficient and cogent evidence if there exists any. In the case of proof of Will, a signature of a testator alone would not prove the execution thereof, if his mind may appear to be very feeble and debilitated. However, if a defence of <strong><u>fraud, coercion or undue influence is raised</u></strong>, the burden would be on the caveator. [See: Madhukar D. Shende v. Tarabai Shedage,  2002-2 SCC 85 and Sridevi v. Jayaraja Shetty, 2005-8 SCC 784]. Subject to above, proof of a Will does not ordinarily differ from that of proving any other document.” (Quoted in: Savithri  v. Karthyayani Amma, 2007-11 SCC 621)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">Should the Second Witness be Examined If the First Witness Turns Hostile</span></strong></p>
<p>If the attesting witness, called for proving the execution of a document, turns hostile, it is not mandated in Sec. 68 that the evidence of the other attesting witnesses should necessarily be brought-in to prove the document. </p>
<p>If a will appears, on the face of it, to have been duly executed and attested in accordance with law, and the materials available ensures that there is  <strong>no chance for fraud</strong>,the court is at liberty <span style="text-decoration: underline">to <strong>give due weight to the presumptions</strong> </span>granted under law (“omni a proe sumuntur rite esse acta); and the court can take the  will as proved and proceed accordingly (See: Lalitaben Jayantilal Popat v. Pragnaben Jamnadas Kataria, (2008) 15 SCC 365).</p>
<p>It is profitable to look Sec. 71, which allows (if the attesting witness examined in court denies execution of the document and his ‘attestation’) to prove the ‘execution’ by adducing “other evidence”; and Sec. 71 does not require compulsory examination of other attesting witness, if any.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Sec. 63(c) of the Succession Act Misread</strong></span></p>
<p>Though the wordings in Sec. 63(c) of the Succession Act read with Sec. 68 and 69 of the Evidence Act do not give rise to another interpretation <sub><sup><strong>(that, if the attesting witness examined in court denies execution, the other attesting witnesses should necessarily be brought-in to prove the document)</strong></sup></sub>, the following decisions and other decisions referred therein <sub><sup><strong>(reading the word “execution” as signing by the testator and the attestation by minimum two witnesses)</strong></sup></sub> presents an opposite view –</p>

<p>The Privy Council, in Roda Framroze Mody v.

<li>“68. Proof of execution of document required by law to be attested—If a document is required by law to be attested, it shall not be used as evidence until one attesting witness at least has been called for the purpose of proving its execution, if there be an attesting witness alive, and subject to the process of the Court and capable of giving evidence:</li>
<li>Provided that it shall not be necessary to call an attesting witness in proof of the execution of any document, <strong><em><u>not being a will</u></em></strong>, which has been registered in accordance with the provisions of the Indian Registration Act, 1908 (16 of 1908), unless its execution by the person by whom it purports to have been executed is specifically denied.</li>
</ul>
<p>In Ramesh Verma v. Rajesh Saxena, 2017-1 SCC 257, our Apex Court held as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“13. A will like any other document is to be proved in terms of the provisions of Sec. 68 of the Evidence Act and the Succession Act, 1925. The propounder of the will is called upon to show by satisfactory evidence that the will was signed by the testator, that the testator at the relevant time was in a sound and disposing state of mind, that he understood the nature and effect of the disposition and put his signature to the document on his own free will and the document shall not be used as evidence until one attesting witness at least has been called for the purpose of proving its execution. This is the mandate of Sec. 68 of the Evidence Act and the position remains the same even in a case where the opposite party does <strong>not specifically deny</strong> the execution of the document in the written statement.”</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><u>Effect of ‘Admission’ of Execution of Will (by the other side</u></strong><strong>)</strong></p>
<p>It may be pointed out that the Apex Court did not consider in this decision, Ramesh Verma v. Rajesh Saxena – what is the position when the opposite party <strong>expressly admit</strong> the execution of the document.</p>
<p>Boomathi v. Murugesan, 2023-2 Mad LJ 684 (DB)</p>
<p>It is held in a recent Division Bench decision in <strong>Boomathi v. Murugesan</strong>, 2023-2 Mad LJ 684, that the position will be different if the Will is<strong> ‘categorically’ and ‘clearly’ <u>admitted</u></strong>. The Madras High Court referred Sec. 17 (Admission) and Sec. 58 (Facts admitted need not be proved) and came to the conclusion , Sec. 68 will not be attracted where the Will is “<strong>admitted</strong>” by the other side. The Division Bench held as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“23. First and foremost, it is to be borne in mind that before the Hon’ble Supreme Court in Jagdish Chand Sharma Vs. Narain Singh Saini [Dead] through Legal Representatives and Others, reported in 2015 [8] SCC 615, the validity of the Will was a core issue and the Hon’ble Supreme Court  proceeded to discuss the law with regard to proof of a Will in accordance with the statute. In such context, the Hon’ble Supreme Court has held that the position with regard to proof of a Will remains the same even if the opposite party does not specifically deny execution of the same.</li>
<li>24. The above judgment has been followed by learned Single Judges of this Court in  P. Malliga Vs. P. Kumaran reported in 2022 [2] LW 393 and Akkinirajan Vs. Maheswari and Others reported in 2023 [1] LW 72.</li>
<li>25. This Court draws the distinction between <strong>‘specifically denied’, ‘not specifically denied’</strong> and ‘<strong>admitted</strong>‘. The first two instances, namely, ‘specifically denied’ and ‘not specifically denied’, would fall within one category. Insofar as proof of a Will in both cases in this category, the Will would have to be necessarily proved by the propounder. However, where the opposite party <strong><em><u>categorically admits</u></em></strong> to the Will, the position would be certainly different. In India, we follow what is called the system ‘adversarial proceedings’, which is also followed in the British Courts. The foundation of this School is that parties before a Court would have to deal with facts in issue namely facts that are asserted and denied by the parties to the lis and the Court would proceed to adjudicate on such issues. When there is no dispute between the parties on certain matters, the Court would not venture to require proof of such admitted facts.”</li>
<li>“33. This Court has applied its mind to the various principles laid down by the Hon’ble  Supreme Court as well as this Court and other High Courts, especially in the context of Sec. 68 of the Indian Evidence Act, proof of a Will where execution is not specifically denied and in cases where the execution is <strong><u>categorically admitted.</u></strong> The ratio laid down by the Hon’ble Supreme Court in Ramesh Verma’s case [cited supra] reported in 2017 [1] SCC 257, cannot be a precedent for the proposition where the opposite party <strong>clearly admits</strong> to the execution of the subject Will as in the instant case. Therefore, we are not in respectful agreement with the judgments in P. Malliga’s case(P. Malliga v. P. Kumaran, 2022 (2) LW 393) andAkkinirajan’s case (Akkinirajan Vs. Maheswari, 2023 [1] LW 72) following the ratio laid down by the Hon’ble Supreme Court in Jagdish Chand Sharma’s case. On the contrary, we approve the ratio laid down in <strong>P. Radha Vs. Irudayadoss</strong> and Others reported in 2022 SCC Online Mad 886 and Vanjiammal and Others Vs. Vidya and Others in the order dtd. 21/4/2017 made in CRP.[PD] No.3659/2013.”</li>
</ul>
<p>The same view is taken in <strong>Rajeev Gupta v. Prashant Garg, 2022-1 All LJ 435</strong>. The court held as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“The <strong><u>admission</u></strong> were in the pleadings of the parties and therefore there was no requirement of proving the will in the present suit. Admittedly, the defendant Nos. 2 to 4/appellants have claimed their title through Ramesh Chand Garg who never disputed the validity of the will rather in the Original Suit No. 458 of 1992, he admitted its validity and therefore, the lower appellate court has rightly decreed the suit and held that the will was neither required to be proved in the present suit nor the filing of original will was necessary.”</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><u>Do General Provisions of S. 58 give way to Special Provisions of S. 68</u></strong></p>
<p>Three views are possible:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>First: Requirement of <strong>calling at lest one witness</strong> to prove those documents that requires attestation, remains the same <strong>even in a case </strong>where the opposite party <strong>expressly admit</strong> the execution of the document in the written statement.</li>
<li>Second: If the Will is <strong>(even impliedly) admitted</strong>, Sec. 68 need not be invoked.</li>
<li>Third: If only the Will is <strong><u>expressly</u> admitted</strong>, then only there will be alleviation of burden laid down in Sec. 68.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the light of the Apex Court decision in Ramesh Verma v. Rajesh Saxena, 2017-1 SCC 257, <sub>(that the position – as to proof of documents requires attestation – remains the same even in a case where the opposite party does <strong>not specifically deny</strong> the execution of the document in the written statement)</sub> it appears that the second view stated above (taken in Thayyullathil Kunhikannan v. Thayyullathil Kalliani, AIR 1990 Ker 226) is not sustainable.</p>
<p>But, the proposition of law in the third view above, applied in <strong>Boomathi v. Murugesan</strong> (supra), and other decisions <sub>(that the position – as to proof of documents requires attestation – will be different if the Will is <strong>“categorically <u>admitted</u>“</strong>),</sub> sounds good.</p>
<p><strong><u>Authoritative Judicial Pronouncement is yet to be Arrived</u></strong></p>
<p>It is also pertinent to note that the Kerala High Court, in <strong>Sarada v. Radhamani</strong> (supra), pointed out that the general provisions of Sect. 58 of the Evidence Act has ‘to give way to the special provisions’ of Sec. 68 of the Act; and it was remarked that there was no distinction between an ‘admitted Will’ and a ‘disputed Will’ as to the mode of proof.</p>
<p>It appears that the placing the doctrine of <em><u>‘specific provisions override general provisions</u></em>‘ is rational; for, the following words in Sec. 68 places a ‘non-obstante clause’ –</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“it shall <strong><u>not be used as evidence</u></strong> until one attesting witness at least has been called for the purpose of proving its execution”.</li>
</ul>
<p>However, it will also be a forceful argument if one says that a section in the Evidence Act cannot be protected from certain fundamental principles of the Evidence Act which include ‘best evidence rule’, ‘admitted facts need not be proved’ etc., unless strong persuasive indications are laid down in the provision concerned. (It is also noteworthy that Sec. 68 does not proceed with a non-obstante clause.) In any event, the scheme of the Evidence Act shows that Chapter III (the beginning Chapter of Part II) which deals with “Facts Need Not be Proved”, is meant to govern the succeeding chapters including the Chapter V that deals with ‘Documentary Evidence’ wherein Sec. 68 is included.</p>
<p>It is also significant – Sec. 58 says that ‘Admitted facts need not be <strong><u>proved</u></strong>’; and Sec. 68 speaks as to “<strong><u>Proof</u></strong> of execution of document required by law to be attested” and that the attesting witness is called “for the purpose of <strong><u>proving</u></strong> its execution”. That is, the question of ‘proof’ under Sec. 68 does not arise if ‘execution of document’ has already been admitted by the other side.</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Note: Proviso to Sec. 58 enables the court to require proof, despite the admission of the other side, if it finds proper. Proviso to Sec. 58 reads as under:</li>
<li>“Provided that the Court may, in its discretion, require the facts admitted to be proved otherwise than by such admissions.”</li>
</ul>
<p>Therefore, an authoritative judicial pronouncement is yet to be arrived, taking note of various potential contentions in this regard.</p>

<p>In Vrindavanibai Sambhaji Mane v. Ramachandra Vithal Ganeshkar, AIR 1995 SC 2086, 1995-5 SCC 215, our Apex Court held as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“There is also a large body of case law about what are suspicious circumstances surrounding the execution of a Will which require the propounder to explain them to the satisfaction of the Court before the Will can be accepted as genuine. A Will has to be proved like any other document except for the fact that it has to be proved after the death of the testator. Hence, the person executing the document is not there to give testimony. The propounder, in the absence of any suspicious circumstances surrounding the execution of the Will, is required to prove the testamentary capacity and the signature of the testator. Some of the suspicious circumstances of which the Court has taken note are</li>
<li>(1) The propounder taking a prominent part in the execution of a Will which confers substantial benefits on him;</li>
<li>(2) Shaky signature;</li>
<li>(3) A feeble mind which is likely to be influenced;</li>
<li>(4) Unfair and unjust disposal of property. Suffice it to say that no such circumstances are present here.”</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><u>Presumption (by itself)<span style="text-decoration: underline"> </span>not sufficient to Prove a Will</u></strong></p>
<p>The Presumptions available on a document cannot be called for (unless Sec. 71 can be invoked, as stated below) as regards a Will, in view of Sec. 68 and 69 of the Evidence Act.</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>That is, <strong>Certificate</strong> of Registering Officer (endorsement) is <strong>not</strong> <strong><u>by itself</u></strong> a proof of the registered Will having been duly executed and attested. </li>
<li>The presumption, under <strong>Sect. 90</strong>, Evidence Act, as to regularity for documents having more than <strong>30 years</strong> of age also cannot be imported in proof Wills (unless Sec. 71 can be invoked, as stated below).</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Proof of Will – Regn. Certificate u/s. 60 – by itself,  NOT Sufficient</strong></span></p>
<p>Registration of a will or codicil, by itself, will not lead to a presumption as to correctness or regularity of attestation. Where in the facts and circumstances of a given case, if the Registrar of Deeds, by his statement before the court, satisfies the requirement as to attestation by an attesting witness, his evidence would be liable to be appreciated and evaluated like the testimony of any other attesting witness. </p>
<p>The Apex Court observed in <strong>Bhagat Ram v. Suresh</strong>, AIR 2004 SC 43 (R.C. Lahoti, J.) as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“The certificate of registration under<strong> </strong>Section 60 of the Registration Act, 1908 raises a presumption under Section<strong> 114 illustration (e)</strong> of the Evidence Act that he had regularly performed his duty and therefore the facts spelled out by the endorsements made under Sections <strong>58 and 59</strong> of the <span style="text-decoration: underline">Registration Act may be presumed to be <strong><mark class="has-inline-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#dc07d3">correct</mark></strong> without formal proof thereof.</span> The duties discharged by the registering officer do not include attestation or verification of attestation of will as required by the rules enacted by Section 63 of the Succession Act.<strong> </strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">An endorsement by registering officer is <strong><u>not by itself</u></strong> <strong>a proof of the will</strong> having been duly <u>executed</u> and attested.</span> …”</li>

<p>The Kerala High Court held in Mariyadas v. Benjamin, ILR 2014-4 Ker 471, as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“If a Will has been registered, that is a circumstance which may, having regard to the circumstances, prove its <strong><mark class="has-inline-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#e808e5"><strong>genuineness</strong></mark></strong>. But the mere fact that <span style="text-decoration: underline">a Will is <strong>registered Will</strong> it will <strong>not by itself</strong> be sufficient to dispel all suspicion </span>regarding it where suspicion exists, without submitting the evidence of registration to a close examination.

</ul>
<p>In <strong>Ashutosh Samanta v. Ranjan Bala Dasi, AIR 2023 SC 1422</strong>, the Supreme Court observed that Wills (which have to be proved in terms of <span style="text-decoration: underline">Section 63(c) </span>of the Succession Act 1925 and Section 68 of the Evidence Act, 1872) <span style="text-decoration: underline">cannot be proved, only on the basis of their age and the presumption under Sec. 90</span> which provides for presumption as to regularity of documents having the age more than <strong>30 years</strong>. (And it was held, following the earlier decisions on Sec. 71 of the Evidence Act, that  in proper cases this enabling provision (Sec. 71) can be invoked, as detailed below.)</p>
<p>In <strong><u>M.B. Ramesh v. K.M. Veeraje Urs, (2013) 7 SCC 490</u>, </strong>it is pointed out as under:</p>

<p>In<strong> Dhanpat v. Sheo Ram (2020) 16 SCC 209) </strong>certified copy of the registered will was produced saying that the original was lost. The Supreme Court observed as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“There is no cross-examination of any of the witnesses of the defendants in respect of loss of original will. Section 65 of the Evidence Act permits secondary evidence of existence, condition, or contents of a document including the cases where the original has been destroyed or lost. The plaintiff had admitted the execution of the will though it was alleged to be the result of fraud and misrepresentation. The execution of the will was not disputed by the plaintiff but only proof of the will was the subject matter in the suit. Therefore, once the evidence of the defendants is that the original will was lost and certified copy is produced, the defendants have made out sufficient grounds for leading of secondary evidence”.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Apex Court further observed that there was no need for an application for submitting the secondary evidence.</p>

<p>There is no specific provision in the Evidence Act as to proving a Will,  where-</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>(a) the attesting witnesses to the Will are dead or not available for examination,</li>
<li>and</li>
<li>(b) no evidence is available (reasonably not obtainable) to show that the Will was attested (say, 75 years back) in the handwriting of the attesting witnesses, as provided under Sec. 69 Evidence Act?</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Sec. 71 of the Evidence Act </strong></span></p>
<p>Sec. 71 of the Evidence Act reads as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>71. <span style="text-decoration: underline">Proof when attesting witness denies the execution</span> – If the attesting witness denies or does not recollect the execution of the document, its execution may be proved by other evidence.”</li>
</ul>
<p>If the attesting witness called for proving the execution of a document turns hostile, though the ‘best evidence rule’ requires the evidence of the other attesting witness, if he is alive, it is not mandated in Sec. 71 (See contra view – the other witness must be examined – in: Vishnu Ramkrishna Wani v. Nathu Vithal Wani, (1949) 51 BOMLR 245, MC Chagla &amp; Gajendragadkar).</p>
<p>It must be noticed that Sec. 71, <span style="text-decoration: underline">as such</span>, cannot be applied when Wills cannot be proved in terms of Sec. 68 and 69; because, <mark class="has-inline-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#1914e8"><font color="#1914e8"><mark class="has-inline-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#d30644">Se</mark><mark class="has-inline-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#d9054d">c. 71</mark></font><mark class="has-inline-color has-primary-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"> </mark></mark><mark class="has-inline-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#da0545">deals with another situation</mark>; i.e., ‘witness denies or does not recollect the execution of the document’. (But, the principles in Sec. 71 can be applied in such situations, it being enacted on the rules as to justice, equity and good conscience.)</p>
<p>Therefore, if the execution and attestation of a Will cannot be proved as provided under Sect. 68  and 69 Evidence Act, it is legitimate to say that the principles in the doctrine of ‘Proving Execution by Other Evidence’ in Sec. 71 of the Evidence Act  can be invoked to prove the Will – that is the execution by the testator (and not the attestation as provided in Sec. 69, the enabling provision).</p>
<p>In <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">Janki Narayan Bhoir v. Narayan Namdeo Kadam</span>,</strong> 2003 (2) SCC 91, it is observed, as regards Sec. 71, as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“<mark class="has-inline-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#222cf4">Section 71 is meant to lend assistance and come to the rescue of a party who had done his best, but driven to a state of helplessness and impossibility cannot be let down without any other means of proving due execution by “other evidence” as well</mark>. At the same time Section 71 cannot be read so as to absolve a party of his obligation under Section 68 read with Section 63 of the Act and liberally allow him, at his will or choice to make available or not a necessary witness otherwise available and amenable to the jurisdiction of the court concerned and confer a premium upon his omission or lapse, to enable him to give a go bye to the mandate of law relating to proof of execution of a will.”</li>
<li>In Janki Narayan Bhoir v. Narayan Namdeo Kadam, our Apex Court not only did not apply Sec. 71, but it found that the Will was not proved (in that case) for not examining the attesting-witness who was available for examination. (Therefore the observations as to Sec. 71 stands as <strong>obiter</strong>.)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><u>Sec. 71  Misapplied</u></strong></p>
<p>In <u>M.B. Ramesh v. K.M. Veeraje Urs, (2013) 7 SCC 490</u><strong>, </strong>it was contended that the evidence of the attesting witness examined in the court was “silent on the issue” as to whether the executant of the will executed the will in the presence of other witness, and whether the other witness also signed as attesting witness in the presence of the executant. Answering the argument, it is held as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“.. . . Section 71 of the Evidence Act is another connected section “which is permissive and an enabling section permitting a party to lead other evidence in certain circumstances” as <strong>observed</strong> by this Court in paragraph 11 of <span style="text-decoration: underline">Janki Narayan Bhoir v.

<li class="has-small-font-size"><em>That is, even if the witness was “silent on the issue” as to whether the executant executed the will <mark class="has-inline-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#e60acd">in the presence of the other witness</mark>, and whether the <mark class="has-inline-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#ec11e2">other witness also signed as attesting witness</mark> in the presence of the executant</em>, they <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">could not have been raised as </span></strong>“deficiency” (as observed in this decision and in Janki Narayan Bhoir).</li>

<p>As shown above, Sec. 71 (which provides for ‘other evidence’) applies in two circumstances-</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>1.  If the attesting witness of the document denies or does not recollect the execution of the document (as stated in Sec. 71 itself).</li>
<li>2. If the attestation of the document cannot be proved as provided under Sect. 68  and 69 Evidence Act (principles in Sec. 71 is applied).</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline">“Other evidence” in Sec. 71 includes all ‘presumptions’ in the Evidence Act</span>.</p>
<p>Therefore, the propounder of a will is free to rely on ‘presumption on registration’ and presumption available under Sec. 90 as regards 30 years old documents (so also other presumptions, including Sec. 114), when Sec. 71 can be invoked.</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>It must be noticed that the presumptions under Sec. 90 and 114 are rebuttable presumptions; and therefore, the opposite party can show – adducing evidence sufficient to displace the presumption – that it is not proper to rely on presumptions.</li>

<li><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">74. Wording of will</span> </strong>— It is not necessary that any technical words or terms of art be used in a Will, but only that the wording be such that the intentions of the testator can be known therefrom.</li>

</ul>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">Cardinal principles</span></strong> in interpretation of a Will are the following:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>(1) Ascertain the <span style="text-decoration: underline">intention</span> of the testator <span style="text-decoration: underline">from the words used</span>; the surrounding circumstances can be considered: but only for finding out the intended meaning of the wordsused. (Ram Gopal v. ;Nand Lal, AIR 1951 SC 139; Navneet Lal v. Gokul, AIR 1976 SC 794: Gnanambal Ammal v. T. Raju Ayyar (1950 SCR 949, 955 : AIR 1951 SC 103)</li>
<li>(2) In construing the language of the will the court is entitled to <span style="text-decoration: underline">put itself into the testator’s armchair</span> (Venkata Narasimha v. Parthasarthy, 41 IA 51: 15 Bom LR 1010; Gnanambal Ammal v. T. Raju Aiyar, AIR 1951 SC 103,)</li>
<li>(3) The true intention of the testator has to be gathered by <span style="text-decoration: underline">reading the will as a whole</span>. <span style="text-decoration: underline">No clause</span> shall <span style="text-decoration: underline">be ignored</span> as redundant or contradictory.  (Raj Bajrang Bahadur Singh v. Thakurain Bakhtraj Kuer (1953 SCR 232, 240 : AIR 1953 SC 7; Gnanambal Ammal v. T. Raju Aiyar, AIR 1951 SC 103; Ramachandra Shenoy v. Mrs. Hilda Brite, (1964) 2 SCR 722, 735 : AIR 1964 SC 1323; Navneet Lal v. Gokul, AIR 1976 SC 794)</li>
<li>(4) If there are two repugnant provisions conferring successive interests, if the <span style="text-decoration: underline">first interest created is valid the subsequent interest cannot take effect</span> but a court of construction will <span style="text-decoration: underline">proceed to the farthest extent to avoid repugnancy</span>, so that<span style="text-decoration: underline"> effect could be given as far as possible</span> to every testamentary intention contained in the will. (Ramachandra Shenoy v. Mrs. Hilda Brite, (1964) 2 SCR 722, 735 : AIR 1964 SC 1323; )</li>
<li> (5) The court must accept, if possible, such construction as would <span style="text-decoration: underline">give to every expression some effect</span> rather than that which would render any of the expressions inoperative. (Navneet Lal v. Gokul, AIR 1976 SC 794)</li>
<li>(6) Where <span style="text-decoration: underline">two reasonable constructions </span>possible and one would lead to intestacy, that should be discarded and the construction that in <span style="text-decoration: underline">favour of Will shall be accepted</span>. (Pearey Lal v. Rameshwar Das, 1963 Supp 2 SCR 834: AIR 1963 SC 1703)</li>
<li>(7) The meaning of every word in an Indian will must always depend upon the setting in which it is placed, the subject to which it is related, and the locality of the testator from which it may receive its true shade of meaning. (Sasiman Chowdhurain v. Shib Narayan Chowdhury,49 IA 25, 35 : 66 IC 193 : 24 Bom LR 576; Musammat Surajmani v. Rahi Nath Ojha, 35 IA 17 : ILR 30 All 84 : 10 Bom LR 59; Navneet Lal v. Gokul, AIR 1976 SC 794)</li>
</ul>
<p>In Gnanambal Ammal v. T. Raju Aiyar, AIR 1951 SC 103, BK Mukherjea, J., held as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“The <span style="text-decoration: underline">cardinal maxim</span> to be observed by courts in construing a will is to endeavour to ascertain the <span style="text-decoration: underline">intentions of the testator</span>. This intention has to be <span style="text-decoration: underline">gathered primarily from the language</span> of the document which is to be <span style="text-decoration: underline">read as a whole</span> without indulging in any conjecture or speculation as to what the testator would have done if he had been better informed or better advised. In construing the language of the will as the <span style="text-decoration: underline">Privy Council </span>observed in Venkata Narasimha v. Parthasarathy, 42 I.A. 51 at p.70.
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>‘The courts are entitled and bound to bear in mind other matters than merely the words used. They must consider the surrounding circumstances, the position of the testator, ‘his family relationship, the probability that he would use words in a particular sense, and many other things which are often summed up in the somewhat picturesque figure ‘The court is entitled to put itself into the <strong><u>testator’s armchair’</u></strong> …… But all this is solely as an aid to arriving at a right construction of the will, and to ascertain the meaning of its language when used by that particular testator in that document. So, soon as the construction is settled, the duty of the court is to carry out the intentions as expressed, and none other. The court is in no case justified in adding to testamentary dispositions…… In all cases it must loyally carry out the will as properly construed, and this duty is universal, and is true alike of wills of every nationality and every religion or rank of life.’</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A question is sometimes raised as to whether in construing a will the court should lean against intestacy. The desire to avoid intestacy was considered by the Privy Council in the case referred to above as a rule based on English necessity and <span style="text-decoration: underline">English habits of thought which should not necessarily bind an Indian court.</span> It seems that a presumption against intestacy may be raised if it is justified by the context of the document or the surrounding circumstances; But <span style="text-decoration: underline">it can be invoked only when there is <strong>undoubted ambiguity in ascertainment of the intentions of the testator</strong></span>. As Lord Justice Romer observed in Re Edwards; Jones v. Jones, [1906]1 Ch. 570 at p. 574:
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>‘It cannot be that merely with a view to avoiding intestacy you are to do otherwise than construe plain words according to their plain meaning’.”</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In Bhura v. Kashi Ram, AIR 1994 SC 1202:  (1994) 2 SCC 111, it is observed as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“It is settled law that the <span style="text-decoration: underline">courts must make all efforts to determine the real intention of the testator</span> by <span style="text-decoration: underline">reading the will as a whole</span> and giving effect to the intentions of the testator. Construction, which would advance the intention of the testator has to be preferred and as far as possible effect is required to be given to every disposition contained in the will, unless the law prevents such effect being given to it.”</li>

<p>Sec. 90 speaks about two things:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>1. a document purports to be in the handwriting of any particular person</li>
<li>2. a document purports to be executed or attested</li>
</ul>
<p>The presumption spoken of in Sec. 90 is the following:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>handwriting – in that person’s handwriting</li>
<li>executed or attested – duly executed and attested.</li>
</ul>
<p>It was a matter of controversy whether truth or genuineness can be attached to the 30-year-old documents (though not specifically stated in Sec. 90).</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong><mark class="has-inline-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#e808e5"><strong>Genuineness</strong></mark></strong></span><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline"> (Not Truth of Contents) attached to 30-year-old Documents</span></strong></p>

<p>In Lakhi Baruah v. Padma Kanta Kalita, (1996) 8 SCC 357, AIR 1996 SC 1253, with regard to admissibility in evidence of thirty years old documents produced from proper custody, it was observed as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li class="has-small-font-size">“15. Section 90 of the Evidence Act, 1872 is founded on necessity and convenience because it is extremely difficult and sometimes not possible to lead evidence to prove handwriting, signature  or execution of old documents after lapse of thirty years. In order to obviate such difficulties or improbabilities to prove execution of an old document, Section 90 has been incorporated in the Evidence Act, 1872 which does away with the strict rule of proof of private documents. <span style="text-decoration: underline">Presumption of <strong><mark class="has-inline-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#e808e5"><strong>genuineness</strong></mark></strong> may be raised</span> if the documents in question is produced from proper custody.

<p>In <strong>Union of India v. Ibrahim Uddin</strong>, (2012) 8 SCC 148, it was held as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li class="has-small-font-size">“Presumption under <span style="text-decoration: underline">Section 90</span> of the Evidence Act in respect of 30 years’ old document coming from proper custody relates to the signature, execution and attestation of a document i.e. to its <mark class="has-inline-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#e808e5"><strong>genuineness</strong></mark> but it does <strong><mark class="has-inline-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#cd09b0">not</mark></strong> give rise to presumption of <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline"><mark class="has-inline-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#b905a4">correctness</mark></span></strong></span></strong> of every statement contained in it. <strong>The contents of the document are<mark class="has-inline-color has-foreground-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"> <span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>true</strong></span></strong></strong></span></mark> </strong>or it had been acted upon <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">have to be proved</span> like any other fact</strong>.”</li>

<p>In Jhasketan Bhoi V. Krushna Bhoi, ILR 2018-2 Cuttack (Orissa) 440. It was held as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li class="has-small-font-size">“It is no-doubt clear that Section 90 of the Indian Evidence Act if any document is produced from proper custody which is executed <span style="text-decoration: underline">30 years back</span> then the document can be proved by production from proper custody. But that does <strong>not mean that the contents of the documents are proved</strong>. The contents of the document have to be proved by cogent evidence.”</li>
</ul>
<p>After reading Sec. 90, the High Court proceeded as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li class="has-small-font-size">“When a document is purportedly to be more than 30 years old, if it be produced from what the Court considers to be proper custody, it may be presumed
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>that the signature and every other part of such document, which purports to be in the handwriting of any particular person, is in that person’s handwriting, and</li>
<li>that it was duly executed and attested by the person by whom it purports to be executed and attested.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="has-small-font-size">Thirty year old document, produced from proper custody, not looking ex facie suspicious, presumption could be drawn in favour of proper execution of the document. It is not necessary that the signatures of the attesting witnesses or of the scribe be proved; if everything was proved there would be no need to presume anything. There can, however, be <strong><mark class="has-inline-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#cf0de2">no presumption</mark> as to</strong>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>who is the person, who executed the document was and</li>
<li>what authority he had to execute the document, and</li>
<li>whether he had the requisite authority, or</li>
<li>whether the <strong>contents of the document are <mark class="has-inline-color has-foreground-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>true</strong></span></strong>.</mark></strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>In other words, the execution and attestation of the document is presumed, but the contents have to be proved by some way or other.”</li>
</ul>
<p>The correct view on Sec. 90 had been expressed in Kunhamina Umma v. Special Tahsildar, AIR 1977 Ker 41, wherein it was observed that this was a matter with the discretion of the court. It also referred to Sec. 114 of the Evidence act. It is held as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li class="has-small-font-size">“10. The true scope of <span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec. 90 </span>of the Evidence Act is that the section <span style="text-decoration: underline">does away with the strict rules of proof</span> which are enforced in the case of private documents, by giving rise to a <span style="text-decoration: underline">presumption of <mark class="has-inline-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#e808e5"><strong>genuineness</strong></mark></span> with regard to documents reaching a certain age. If private documents not less than thirty years old are produced from <span style="text-decoration: underline">proper custody</span>, and are on their face free from suspicion, the court may presume that they have been <span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>signed or written by the person</strong></span> whose signatures they bear or in whose handwriting they purport to be, and that they have been duly attested and executed, if they purport so to be. In other words, documents thirty years old prove themselves–see Sirkar on Evidence 12th Edn. page 727.</li>
<li class="has-small-font-size">The section <strong><u>deals with the admissibilit</u>y</strong> of such old documents without proof in the usual manner, <strong><u>but</u></strong><span style="text-decoration: underline"> <strong>the credit to be given to them depends</strong></span><strong> <u>on the discretion of the court </u></strong>exercised in a judicial manner and the particular circumstances of each case. No doubt, the presumption is permissive and according to the circumstances of each case the court may or may not raise it. It has also been held in certain cases that a sound disposing mind can be presumed under Sec. 90, This is so ‘because of the expression <strong>‘<mark class="has-inline-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#f9079b">duly executed</mark>’</strong>in the section. The word duly has to be taken to mean execution by a person legally competent to execute the document–see (1) Kottayya v. Karancheti– AIR 1930 Mad 744 (2) Munnalal v. Kshibai — AIR 1947 PC 15; (3) Venkatarama v Bhaskar Rao — AIR 1962 Andh Pra 29.</li>
<li class="has-small-font-size"><strong>This presumption is fortified by </strong><mark class="has-inline-color has-primary-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><strong>Sec. 114 Evidence Ac</strong>t</mark>. Again it may be made clear that it is in the discretion of the court to draw the presumption or not.”</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>“<span style="text-decoration: underline">Proper Custody</span>”</strong></p>
<p>As regards the ‘proper custody’ in Sec. 90 Evidence Act it is observed in Cheedella Padmavathi v. Cheedella Lakshminarasimha Rao, 2015(5) ALT 634, as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“The proper custody is in the custody of a person, who might be reasonably and naturally be expected to have possession of them.” </li>
</ul>
<p>In Rangaswami v. T.V. Krishnan, 2011-1 CC 832, it is observed that ‘proper custody means custody of an individual connected with deed and its possession does not excite any fraud or suspicion’.</p>

Presumption as to ‘<strong><mark class="has-inline-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#5713f9">truth</mark></strong>‘ of Contents is dealt with in the (main) section.

<p>Illustration (e) of Sec. 114, Evd.

<p>For such presumption, we have to resort the main section, Sec. 114 – that is, ‘common course of natural events’, ‘human conduct’, etc..</p>
<p>In Inder Singh v. S. Raghbir Singh, AIR 1978 P&amp;H 98, it is observed as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">

</ul>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline">Do Presumptions as to <strong>VALID</strong> <strong>EXECUTION </strong>Import</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong><mark class="has-inline-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#310df3">TRUTH</mark></strong></span> <span style="text-decoration: underline">of Contents</span>?</p>
<p>Under Sec. 114 of the Evidence Act, court can presume the existence of any fact. </p>
<p>The Indian Evidence Act does not specifically correlate <strong>“<strong><span style="text-decoration:underline"><span style="text-decoration:underline"><strong><u><mark class="has-inline-color has-primary-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Truth of Contents</mark></u></strong></span></span></strong>“</strong> or <strong>“correctness”</strong> with ‘presumption’. But, ‘any fact’ stated in Sec. 114 of the Evidence Act (Court may presume the existence of any fact) includes ‘<strong><span style="text-decoration:underline"><span style="text-decoration:underline"><strong><u><mark class="has-inline-color has-primary-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Truth of Contents</mark></u></strong></span></span></strong>‘. As shown above, it is clear from the Stroud’s Legal Dictionary that presumption is a probable consequence drawn from facts as to the <span style="text-decoration:underline"><strong>truth</strong> of a fact alleged</span>. It is clear that, in presumption, the existence or <span style="text-decoration:underline"><strong>truth </strong>of a fact, otherwise doubtful</span>, is inferred from certain other proved facts.  Here, the Court exercises a process of reasoning and reach a logical conclusion as the most probable position (See: St. of West Bengal Vs. Mir Mohammad Omar, AIR 2000 SC 2988).</p>
<p>In proper cases, the court can infer ‘<strong><mark class="has-inline-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#5713f9">truth</mark>’</strong> (over and above) presumption as to VALID EXECUTION. Presumption as to VALID EXECUTION  &amp; CORRECTNESS to registration, need not always lead to further Presumption as to ‘<strong><mark class="has-inline-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#5713f9">truth</mark></strong>’ of contents. </p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Burden of Proof and Presumption</strong></span></p>
<p>The party in whom the ‘burden of proof’ rests can rely on ‘registration certificate’ as proof and <span style="text-decoration: underline"><mark class="has-inline-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#e205d1"><strong><strong><mark class="has-inline-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#5713f9">truth</mark></strong></strong></mark></span> of the contents of the deed. Therefore, the certificate endorsed on a registered deed by the registering officer is a relevant piece of evidence for proving its <strong>execution</strong> (Piara v. Fatnu, AIR 1929 Lah 711).</p>
<p>As shown above, besides the presumption on a registered document that it is validly executed, there is also a presumption that the “<span style="text-decoration: underline">transaction is a </span><strong><u><mark class="has-inline-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#e808e5"><strong>genuine</strong></mark> one</u></strong>” (<strong>Vimal Chand Ghevarchand Jain v.

And, there will be <strong>no requirement to “prove the truth of contents” as regards a Will</strong>; and, proof of its execution alone will be sufficient. </p>
