<p><strong><u><strong>THREE RULES OF INTERPRETATION</strong></u></strong></p>
<p>There are three rules of Interpretation of Statutes and Documents. They are:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong><em><u>Literal rule,</u></em></strong></li>
<li><strong><em><u>Mischief rule, and</u></em></strong></li>
<li><strong><em><u>Golden rule.</u></em></strong> </li>
</ul>
<p><strong><u>The Literal rule</u></strong></p>
<p>It applies to the interpretation of Statutes and all Instruments.</p>
<p>According to this rule, the words in the statute or the document are taken in its literal or plain meaning. It is also called the ‘<strong>plain meaning rule</strong> <strong>or Grammatical Rule</strong>’.</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>This rule can be applied only when the <span style="text-decoration: underline">language in the statute or the document renders only one meaning</span>, and the intention of the legislature or author is unambiguous and completely clear. When a court has to give effect to the statute or document, it has to simply give effect to the language of the statute or document and it <span style="text-decoration: underline">need not look into the consequences that may be arisen therefrom.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><mark class="has-inline-color has-primary-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Several Courts in India (mistakenly) consider and use the Golden Rule of interpretation in place of Literal Rule of interpretation.  </mark></p>
<p><strong><u><mark class="has-inline-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#120df7">THE GOLDEN RULE</mark></u></strong></p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>It is a deviation from the literal rule. It also applies to the interpretation of Statutes and all Instruments.</li>
<li>It applies when literal rule fails for the words used by the author of a document or legislature could not be given their natural meaning for, its lack of clarity, or it renders another meaning  also. </li>
<li>In such cases the <strong><u>apt meaning</u></strong> is given by interpretation, <span style="text-decoration: underline">modifying  the meaning of the absurd term, or choosing one meaning from more than one meaning</span>.</li>
<li>But, in certain decisions, it is observed that the Golden Rule of Interpretation is “the interpretation in conformity with the plain language” of the statute. (See: M/S Patil Automation Private Ltd. v. Rakheja Engineers Private Ltd., AIR 2022 SC 3848, 2022-10 SCC 1). In this view of the matter, this rule essentially gives effect to the literal or ordinary meaning of the words <span style="text-decoration: underline">choosing one meaning from more than one meaning</span> or  <span style="text-decoration: underline">modifying (slightly) the meaning of the absurd term</span>. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong><u>Grey v. Pearson, 1857</u></strong></p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>The golden rule of interpretation was propounded for the first time by Lord Wensleydale, in Grey v. Pearson, 1857 (6) HLC 61, in the construction of a Will. (See: Ms. Eera Through Dr. Manjula v.  State  (Govt. of NCT of Delhi), (2017) 15 SCC 133). </li>
<li>It requires giving effect to the actual meaning of the words used in statutes and other documents.  This rule gives effect to the literal or ordinary meaning of the words used.</li>
</ul>
<p>In Grey v. Pearson, 1857 (6) HLC 61, Lord Wensleydale declared as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“I have been long and deeply impressed with the wisdom of the rule, now, I believe, universally adopted, at least in the Courts of Law in Westminster Hall, that in <strong><u>construing wills</u></strong> and <strong><u>indeed statutes</u></strong>, and all written instruments, the <strong><u>grammatical and ordinary sense of the words is to be adhered to</u></strong>, <span style="text-decoration: underline">unless that would lead to some absurdity</span>, or some repugnance or inconsistency with the rest of the instrument, in which case the grammatical and ordinary sense of the words may be modified, so as to avoid that absurdity and inconsistency, <span style="text-decoration: underline">but no farther</span>. This is laid down by Mr. Justice Burton, in a very excellent opinion, which is to be found in the case of Warburton v. Loveland.”</li>
</ul>
<p><mark class="has-inline-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#0002db"><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>The Mischief Rule</strong> (<strong>Purposive Construction Rule</strong>)</span></mark></p>
<p>It applies basically to the interpretation of Statutes; and not to (private) documents. The aim of this rule is to <strong><u>cure or prevent the mischief </u></strong>of the language in a statute, and give effect to its intention or purpose. Therefore, it is called <strong><u>purposive construction rule</u></strong>. </p>
<p><strong><u>Heydon’s case, (1584)</u></strong></p>
<p>The mischief rule, called Heydon’s rule, is originated by Lord Poke in Heydon’s case, (1584) 3 Co Rep 7a: (1584) 76 ER 637. As per this rule, the meaning and purport of the statute or document is explored and interpreted in that way.  The rule of purposive interpretation was articulated in Heydon’s case  in the following terms:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“for the sure and true interpretation of all statutes in general (be they penal or beneficial, restrictive or enlarging of the common law) four things are to be discerned and considered:
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>1st. What was the common law before the making of the Act.</li>
<li>2nd. What was the mischief and defect for which the common law did not provide.</li>
<li>3rd. What remedy Parliament hath resolved and appointed to cure the disease of the commonwealth.</li>
<li>And, 4th. The true reason of the remedy; and then the office of all the Judges is always to make such construction as shall suppress the mischief, and advance the remedy, and to suppress subtle inventions and evasions for continuance of the mischief, and pro privato commodo, and to add force and life to the cure and remedy, according to the true intent of the makers of the Act, pro bono publico” (Quoted in: X v. Principal Secretary, Health And Family Welfare Department, Govt.  of NCT of Delhi, AIR 2022 SC 4917)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><em>Smith v. Huges, 1960 WLR 830</em></strong></p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>In 1959, the Street Offences Act was enacted in the UK with a view to prohibit prostitutes from soliciting public passing on the roads. Thereon, the prostitutes started soliciting from balconies and windows of the buildings by the side of the roads. The prostitutes were charged under the Act. The courts applied the <strong><em><u>mischief rule</u></em></strong> of interpretation and gave effect to the intention of the Act.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><em>Kanwar Singh v. Delhi Administration, </em></strong>AIR 1965 SC 871</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Facts of the case were as follows- <strong><em> Delhi Corporation Act,</em></strong> 1902 authorised the corporation to round up the <strong>abandoned cattle</strong> grazing on the government land. The MCD rounded up the cattle belonging to Kanwar Singh. It was contended by Kanwar Singh that the word <strong>abandoned </strong>means the loss of ownership and those cattle which were round up belonged to him and hence, was not abandoned. The court held that the <strong><u>mischief rule</u></strong> had to be applied and the word abandoned must be interpreted to mean <strong>let loose or left unattended </strong>and even the <strong>temporary loss of ownership </strong>would be covered as abandoned.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><u><mark class="has-inline-color has-primary-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Golden Rule of Interpretation Covers Wills, Statutes and Instruments</mark></u></strong></p>
<p>After quoting  Grey v. Pearson, 1857 (6) HLC 61, it is observed in Ms. Eera Through Dr. Manjula v.  State (Govt. Of NCT of Delhi), AIR 2017 SC 34577, as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“This celebrated passage has since come to represent what has been described as the ‘Golden Rule’ of interpretation of statutes. The <span style="text-decoration: underline">construction of a clause in a will </span>was before the House of Lords and not the construction of a statute. Nevertheless, the “Golden Rule” was held to cover the construction of <span style="text-decoration: underline">wills, statutes and all other written instruments.</span>”</li>
</ul>
<p>In Kehar Singh v. State (Delhi Admn.), (1988) 3 SCC 609, a three-judge Bench of our Apex Court held as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“231. During the last several years, the <span style="text-decoration: underline">“golden rule” has been given a go-by. We now look for the “intention” of the legislature or the “purpose”</span> of the statute. First, we examine the words of the statute. If the words are precise and cover the situation in hand, we do not go further. We expound those words in the natural and ordinary sense of the words. But, <span style="text-decoration: underline">if the words are ambiguous, uncertain or any doubt arises as to the terms employed, we deem it as our paramount duty to put upon the language of the legislature rational meaning.</span> We then examine every word, every section and every provision. We examine the Act as a whole. We examine the necessity which gave rise to the Act. <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">We look at the mischiefs which the legislature intended to redress</span>.</strong> We look at the whole situation and not just one-to-one relation. We will not consider any provision out of the framework of the statute. We will not view the provisions as abstract principles separated from the motive force behind. <span style="text-decoration: underline">We will consider the provisions in the circumstances to which they owe their origin.</span> We will consider the provisions to ensure coherence and consistency within the law as a whole and to avoid undesirable consequences.” (Quoted in: X v. Principal Secretary, Health And Family Welfare Department, Govt.  of NCT of Delhi, AIR 2022 SC 4917; Indian Handicrafts Emporium v. Union of India, 2003-7 SCC 589, National Insurance Co.  Ltd.  v. Laxmi Narain Dhut,  2007-3 SCC 700)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Lee v. Knapp, (1967) 2 QB 442.</strong> </p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>In this case, it was required to interpret the world ‘stop’. Under the relevant Act, a <span style="text-decoration: underline">driver causing an accident had to ‘stop’ after the accident</span>. But, the driver in this case stopped the vehicle for a moment after causing the accident and then moved away. Applying the golden rule the Court held that requirement of the section had not been followed for the driver did not ‘<span style="text-decoration: underline">stop for a reasonable period of time</span>’ and made an attempt to look for the interested persons to make necessary inquiries for him about the accident.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>U. P. Bhoodan Yagna Samiti v. Brij Kishore, AIR 1988 SC 2239</strong></p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>In this case Section 14 of the U.P Bhoodan Yagna Act, 1953 had to be interpreted. This Section provided land for “<span style="text-decoration: underline">landless person”. It was interpreted as the “landless agricultural labourers”</span> though the Section did not specify that such landless persons should be agricultural labourers or whose source of livelihood should be agriculture; and source of livelihood of those persons should not be trade and business.</li>
</ul>
<p>Our Apex Court, in Rakesh Kumar Paul v. State of Assam, (2017) 15 SCC 67, held as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“67. While interpreting any statutory provision, it has always been accepted as a <strong><u>Golden rule of Interpretation</u></strong> that the words used by the legislature should <span style="text-decoration: underline">be given their natural meaning.</span> Normally, the courts should be hesitant to add words or subtract words from the statutory provision. An effort should always be made to read the legislative provision in such a way that there is no wastage of words and any <span style="text-decoration: underline">construction which makes some words of the statute redundant should be avoided</span>. No doubt, if the natural meaning of the words leads to an interpretation which is contrary to the objects of the Act or makes the provision unworkable or highly unreasonable and arbitrary, then the courts either add words or subtract words or read down the statute, but this should only be done when there is an ambiguity in the language used.” Quoted in:<strong> V. Senthil Balaji Vs. The State represented by Deputy Director (2023)</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline">Advantages of Golden rule</span></p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>This rule simply puts the words in the statute or deed work. It is destined to operate in between ‘literal interpretation’ and ‘mischief-rule interpretation’.</li>
<li>It gives effect to the words used by the legislature or author, in its ordinary meaning; but, picking up the most sensible and apt meaning to the words used the statute or deed – susceptible to more than one meaning. </li>
<li>Applying the Golden Rule, one can deviate from the meaning of words given previously, if it is susceptible to more than one meaning.</li>
<li>Drafting errors in status and documents can be corrected without much effort.</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline">Disadvantage of Golden Rule</span></p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>There is no definite frame-work or guidelines.</li>
<li>It is susceptible for change according to the interpreter or court, if it is accommodative of more than one meaning.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><mark class="has-inline-color has-primary-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">PART II</mark></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">Interpretation of documents involves questions of law</span></strong></p>
<p>In Sir Chunilal V. Mehta v. The Century Spinning and Manufacturing Co. Ltd., AIR 1962 SC 1314, it is observed as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“Indeed it is well settled that the <span style="text-decoration: underline">construction of a document of title</span> or of a document which is the foundation of the rights of parties necessarily raises a question of law.”</li>
</ul>
<p>In Hero Vinoth Minor v. Seshammal, AIR 2006 SC 2234, it is observed as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“It is now well settled that an <span style="text-decoration: underline">inference of fact</span> from a document is a question of fact. But the legal effect of the terms or a term of a document is a <span style="text-decoration: underline">question of law</span>. Construction of a document involving the application of a principle of law, is a question of law. Therefore, when there is a misconstruction of a document or wrong application of a principle of law while interpreting a document, it is <span style="text-decoration: underline">open to interference under Section 100 CPC</span>. If a document creating an easement by grant is construed as an ‘easement of necessity’ thereby materially affecting the decision in the case, certainly it gives rise to a substantial question of law.”</li>
</ul>
<p>In Bhikan Sk. Noor Mohd v. Mehamoodabee Sk. Afzal,  (2017) 5 SCC 127 : AIR 2017 SC 1243, it is laid down as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“When the Court is called upon to interpret the documents and examine its effect, it involves questions of law. It is, therefore, obligatory upon the High Court to decide such questions on merits. In this case, the High Court could do so after framing substantial questions of law as required under Section 100 of the Code.”</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><u>Interpretation of Documents – as provided under Evidence Act</u></strong></p>
<p>Odgers’ “Construction of Deeds and Statutes” (5th ed. 1967) states the following as the First General Rule of Interpretation:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“The meaning of the document or of a particular part of it is therefore to be sought for in the document itself”.</li>
</ul>
<p>Referring the above, it is held in Delhi Development Authority v. Durga Chand Kaushish, AIR 1973 SC 2609, as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“That is, undoubtedly, the primary rule of construction to which Sections 90 to 94 of the Indian providence Act give statutory recognition and effect with certain exceptions contained in Sections 95 to 98 of the Act. Of course, “the document” means “the document” read as a whole and not piecemeal.”</li>
</ul>
<p><em><u>Produce Document itself</u></em></p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>(i)  Oral admissions as to contents of documents are not relevant (Sec. 22); The law requires production of Document itself (Sec. 91);  . </li>
</ul>
<p><em><u>No oral evidence </u></em><em><u>can be given</u></em> –</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>(ii) for varying, adding to, etc. its terms (S. 92).</li>
<li>(iii) to explain a document, on its face, ambiguous (S. 93).</li>
<li>(iv) to show a plain document not meant to apply such facts (S. 94).</li>
</ul>
<p><em><u>Evidence can be given when –</u></em></p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>(v) language of a document, plain in itself, but it is unmeaning in reference to existing facts – evidence may be given to show that it was used in a peculiar sense (S. 95).</li>
<li>(vi) language used – meant to apply to more – evidence may be given to show which of those persons or things was intended (S. 96).</li>
<li>(vii) language used – <em>applies partly to one set facts and partly to another set</em> – evidence may be given to show which of the two sets (S. 97).</li>
<li>(viii) language used – <em>applies partly to one set facts and partly to another set </em>– evidence may be given to show which of the two sets  (S. 97).</li>
<li>(ix) Evidence can be given to show meaning of illegible or technical words -used in a peculiar sense (S. 98).</li>
</ul>
<p><em><u>Interpretation of Will – Provisions of Law</u></em></p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>(i) Sec. 91 to 99 of the Evidence Act do not affect construction of wills (S. 100).</li>
<li>(ii) Sec. 74 of the Indian Succession Act, 1925, contains the <strong><em><u>armchair</u></em></strong> rule. It conveys – intention of the testator is important.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">Odgers Rules</span></strong></p>
<p>Odgers Rules, supra, (known as golden rules of interpretation) are the following:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>1. The meaning of the document or of a particular part of it is therefore to be sought for in the document itself.</li>
<li>2. The intention may prevail over the words used</li>
<li>3. words are to be taken in their literal meaning</li>
<li>4. literal meaning depends on the circumstances of the parties</li>
<li>5. When is extrinsic evidence admissible to translate the language?</li>
<li>6. Technical legal terms will have their legal meaning.</li>
<li>7. Therefore the deed is to be construed as a whole. Apart from the said seven rules listed by Odger, it would be convenient to list the following rules for the sake of convenience are called additional rules and given number in continuation:</li>
<li>8. Same words to be given the same meaning in the same contract.</li>
<li>9. Harmonious construction must be placed on the contract as far as possible. However, in case of conflict between earlier or later clauses in a contract, later clauses are to be preferred to the earlier; while in a will, earlier clause is to be preferred to the later.</li>
<li>10. Contra Proferendum Rule-If two interpretations are possible, the one favourable to the party who has drafted the contract and the other against him, the interpretation against that party has to be preferred.</li>
<li>11. If two interpretation of a contract are possible the one which helps to make the contract operative to be preferred to the other which tends to make it inoperative.</li>
<li>12. In case of conflict between printed clauses and typed clauses, type clauses are to be preferred. Similarly, in conflict between printed and hand written clauses, hand written clauses are to be preferred and in the event of conflict between typed and hand written clauses, the hand written calluses are to be preferred.</li>
<li>13. the special will exclude the general.</li>
<li>14. Rule of expression unius est exclusion alterius.</li>
<li>15. Rule of noscitus a souciss.</li>
<li>16. Ejusdem generic rule will apply both the contract and statute.</li>
<li>17. place of Punctuation in interpretation of documents.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">N</span></strong><span style="font-weight: bold;text-decoration: underline">o statutory rules to interpret any document</span> </p>
<p>In P. Madhusudhan Rao v.  Lt. Col. Ravi Manan, 2015-4 ALD 409, it was observed as under as to interpretation of a document-</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Intention of the executant of a document has to be ascertained by reference to the words used to express it.</li>
<li>Unexpressed intention has <strong><u>not</u></strong> to be considered, but courts can consider presumed intention while interpreting a document.</li>
<li>The Court has to ascertain the intention of the parties based on the language used in the document.</li>
<li>There are no statutory rules to interpret any document.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><u>Primary rule of construction in Evidence Act </u></strong></p>
<p>The Supreme Court, in <strong><u>Delhi Development Authority v. Durga Chand</u></strong>, AIR 1973 SC 2609,  has noticed Odgers Rules, in  “Construction of Deeds and Statutes”, and quoted the First General Rule of Interpretation which reads as under: </p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“The meaning of the document or of a particular part of it is therefore to be sought for in the document itself”.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">Give effect to words used, and Not to the presumed intention</span></strong> </p>
<p>Our Apex Court, in <strong><u>Delhi Development Authority v. Durga Chand</u></strong>, AIR 1973 SC 2609,  further pointed out that ‘<span style="text-decoration: underline">the primary rule of construction</span> to <span style="text-decoration: underline">which Sections 90 to 94</span> of the Indian Evidence Act <span style="text-decoration: underline">give statutory recognition </span>and effect’ and with certain exceptions contained in Sections 95 to 98 of the Act, “the document” means “the document” ‘<span style="text-decoration: underline">read as a whole and not piecemeal</span>’. Then the Apex Court observed as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“The rule stated above follows logically, from the Literal Rule of Construction which, unless its application produces absurd results must be resorted to first. This is clear from the following passages cited in Odgers’ short book under the First Rule of Interpretation set out above: Lord Wensleydale in Monypenny v. Monypenny(1) said: “the question is not what the parties to a deed may have intended to do by entering into that deed, but what is the meaning of the words used in that deed: a most important distinction in all cases of construction and the disregards of which often leads to erroneous conclusions.”</li>
<li>Brett, L.J., in Re Meredith, ex p. Chick ([1879] 11 Ch. D. 731) observed: “I am disposed to follow the rule of construction which was laid down by Lord Denman and Baron Parke… They said that in construing instruments you must have, regard <span style="text-decoration: underline">not to the presumed intention</span> of the parties, but to the <span style="text-decoration: underline">meaning of the words which they have used</span>.”</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Earlier words of deed, or main purpose accepted (rejecting uncertain words)</strong></span></p>
<p>It is further laid down in <strong><u>Delhi Development Authority v. Durga Chand</u></strong>, AIR 1973 SC 2609,  as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“Assuming, however, that there is some c<span style="text-decoration: underline">onflict between an earlier part</span> of the deed containing a demise of land clearly for a period of 90 years on an annual rent of Rs. 365, and the proviso of covenant No. 9, annexed to the demise, <span style="text-decoration: underline">in a later part of the deed</span>, which cannot be resolved without discarding or disregarding some word or words, the respondent’s counsel contended that the earlier words of demise, consistently supported by the contents of other parts of the deed, should prevail over the inconsistency found in the proviso to one of the conditions in the later part of the deed. He relied for this proposition on : Sahebzada Mohd. Kamgar Shah v. Jagdish Chandra Rao Dhabel Deo  [1960] 3 SCR 604); Ramkishore Lal v. Kamal Narian([1963] Supp. 2 SCR v. 417); Forbes v. Git ([1922] 1 AC 256).</li>
<li>We think that the proviso to covenant No. 9 could be said to suffer from the vice of an uncertainty which can only be removed by <span style="text-decoration: underline">ignoring the words creating this uncertainty</span>. We think that, in such a case, the <span style="text-decoration: underline">ambiguous words can be disregarded </span>so that the terms of the earlier operative part of the demise, which are clear, must prevail. Learned Counsel for the respondent also relied on the following passsage from Glyn and Ors. v. Margetson &amp; Co.( [1893] A. C. p. 351) in the judgment of Lords Halsbury :</li>
<li>“<span style="text-decoration: underline">Looking at the whole of the instrument</span>, and seeing that one must regard, for a reason which I will give in a moment, as its main purpose, <span style="text-decoration: underline">one must reject words, indeed whole provisions, if they are inconsistent with what one assumes to be the main purpose of the contract.</span>“</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Gant to be construed in favour of the grantee</strong></span></p>
<p>In Smt. Bina Das Gupta and Others v. Sachindra Mohan Das Gunta, AIR 1968 SC 39, the following statement of law in Stavill Eros., Ltd. v. Bethell ([1902]-2 Ch. 523) , by Sterling L.J., was cited with approval (as observed in <u>Delhi Development Authority v. Durga Chand</u>, AIR 1973 SC 2609) –</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“It is a settled rule of construction that where there is a grant and an exception out of it, the exception is to be taken as inserted for the <span style="text-decoration: underline">benefit of the garntor and to be construed in favour of the grantee</span>. If then the grant be clear, but the exception be so framed as to be, bad for uncertainty, it appears to us that on this principle the grant is operative and the exception fails.”</li>

<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Another rule which seems to us to be applicable here was thus stated by this Court in Radha Sunder Dutta v. Mohd.

<p>In P. Madhusudhan Rao v.  Lt. Col. Ravi Manan, 2015-4 ALD 409,  after referring the Supreme Court decision,  in Delhi Development Authority v. Durga Chand, AIR 1973 SC 2609, it is observed as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“As the observation of the Supreme Court (Delhi Development Authority v. Durga Chand) have the force of law of the land, it may be taken Odgers Rules (known as golden rules of interpretation) have been judicially recognized and may be adopted as Rules for interpretation of the documents in India.</li>
<li>These Rules are listed hereunder:</li>
<li>1. The meaning of the document or of a particular part of it is therefore to be sought for in the document itself.</li>
<li>2. The intention may prevail over the words used</li>
<li>3. words are to be taken in their literal meaning</li>
<li>4. literal meaning depends on the circumstances of the parties</li>
<li>5. When is extrinsic evidence admissible to translate the language?</li>
<li>6. Technical legal terms will have their legal meaning.</li>
<li>7. Therefore the deed is to be construed as a whole.</li>
</ul>
<p>Apart from the said seven rules listed by Odger, it would be convenient to list the following rules for the sake of convenience are called additional rules and given number in continuation:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>8. Same words to be given the same meaning in the same contract.</li>
<li>9. Harmonious construction must be placed on the contract as far as possible. However, in case of conflict between earlier or later clauses in a contract, later clauses are to be preferred to the earlier; while in a will, earlier clause is to be preferred to the later.</li>
<li>10. Contra Proferendum Rule- If two interpretations are possible, the one favourable to the party who has drafted the contract and the other against him, the interpretation against that party has to be preferred.</li>
<li>11. If two interpretation of a contract are possible the one which helps to make the contract operative to be preferred to the other which tends to make it inoperative</li>
<li>12. In case of conflict between printed clauses and typed clauses, type clauses are to be preferred. Similarly, in conflict between printed and hand written clauses, hand written clauses are to be preferred and in the event of conflict between typed and hand written clauses, the hand written calluses are to be preferred</li>
<li>13. the special will exclude the general</li>
<li>14. Rule of expression unius est exclusion alterius</li>
<li>15. Rule of noscitur a sociis</li>
<li>16. Ejusdem generis rule will apply both the contract and statute</li>
<li>17. place of Punctuation in interpretation of documents”.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">Ejusdem Generis</span></strong> <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">&amp;</span></strong> <strong><u>Noscitur a Sociis</u></strong></p>
<p><strong><u>Ejusdem Generis</u></strong> is the principle of interpretation of applying meaning to a doubtful word or words taken from the associated words. Usually this principle is applied when doubts are arisen whether the word or words fall within the general words like – <em>other articles, etc., such things, similar acts,</em> etc.</p>
<p>The ejusdem generis is explained in Halsbury’s Laws of England as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“As a rule, where in a statute there are general words following particular and specific words, the general words must be confined to things of the same kind as those specified, although this, as a rule of construction; must be applied with caution, and subject to the primary rule that statutes are to be construed in accordance with the intention of Parliament. For the ejusdem rule to apply, the specific words must constitute a category, class or genus; if they do constitute such a category, class or genus, then only things which belong to that category, class or genus fall within the general words.”</li>
</ul>
<p>Our Apex Court, in DN Singh v. Commissioner of Income Tax (2023), the question came for consideration was whether ‘bitumen’ (used for tarring roads) would fall under<strong><u> “other valuable article</u>”</strong> stated in “any money, bullion, jewellery or <strong><u>other valuable article</u>” </strong>in Section 69A of the Income Tax. Section 69A reads as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“69A. Unexplained money, etc. – Where in any financial year the assessee is found to be the owner of any money, bullion, jewellery or <strong><u>other valuable article</u></strong> and … not recorded in the books of account, …  may be deemed to be the income of the assessee for such financial year.”</li>
</ul>
<p>It was held in DN Singh v. Commissioner of Income Tax (2023) that ‘bitumen is <em><u>not a valuable article</u></em>’ when the <strong><u>Principle of Ejusdem Generis</u></strong> is applied.</p>
<p><strong><u>Noscitur a Sociis</u></strong> is a rule is broader than the maxim ejusdem generis.  It contains the basic philosophy that the meaning of a doubtful word is ascertained by reference to the meaning of words associated with it. [In practice, it is seen that ‘ejusdem generis’ is applied when words like – <em>other articles, etc., such things, similar acts,</em> etc. are used; and ‘<u>Noscitur a Sociis</u>‘ is used even if those words are not used.]</p>
<p><strong><u>Intention of the parties looked into When there is ambiguity</u></strong></p>
<p>In P. Madhusudhan Rao v.  Lt. Col. Ravi Manan, 2015-4 ALD 409 after quoting the above rules, it is observed as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“From the Rules stated above, when the language used in a document is unambiguous conveying clear meaning, the Court has to interpret the document or any condition therein taking into consideration of the literal meaning of the words in the document. When there is ambiguity, the intention of the parties has to be looked into. Ordinarily the parties use apt words to express their intention but often they do not. The cardinal rule again is that, clear and unambiguous words prevail over the intention. But if the words used are not clear or ambiguous, intention will prevail. The most essential thing is to collect the intention of the parties from the expressions they have used in the deed itself. What if, the intention is so collected will not secure with the words used. The answer is the intention prevails. Therefore, if the language used in the document is unambiguous, the words used in the document itself will prevail but not the intention.”</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><u>Words in the Instruments Matters; Not to the Presumed Intention</u></strong></p>
<p>Brett L.J. in Re Meredith, ex parte Chick, (1879) 11 Ch D 731, observed as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“I am disposed to follow the rule of construction which was laid down by Lord Denman and Baron Parke ……. They said that in construing instruments you must have regard not to the presumed intention of the parties, but to the meaning of the words which they have used.” (Quoted in: VS Talwar v. Prem Chandra Sharma, AIR 1984 SC 664; Damodaram Pillai v. Dhanalakshmi Ammal, (1981) 1 MLJ 171; Thomas v. AA Henry, 2008(2) KLT 63.)</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Vague and uncertain <span style="text-decoration: underline">descriptions rejected; </span>definite and certain, preferred</strong></span></p>
<p>The Kerala High Court held in Velu v. Padmavathy Amma (1983 KLN 38 Case No.39), as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“According to learned counsel for the appellants, when there is conflict in description by measurements and boundaries, measurements prevail over boundaries while according to learned counsel for the respondents, the contrary is the correct position. I have been referred in this connection to the following decisions : Zamindar of Pahipenta vs. Maharajah of Jeypore (XXIII M.L.J. 97) Subbayya Chakkiliyan vs. Manjan Muthia Goundan and another (A.I.R. 1924 Mad. 493), Durga Prasad Singh vs. Rajendra Narain Bagehi (I.L.R. 37 Cal. 293), Kumara Krishnan vs. Ulahannan Mathai (1957 K.L.T. 42), Chacko Joseph vs. Varghese Markose (1957 K.L.T. 485), Savarimuthu Nadar Chellayyan Nadar vs. Kanakku Rali Pillai Padmanabha Pillai (1957 K.L.T.825) and Krishnamurthy Iyer vs. Janaki Amma (1957 K.L.T. 886).</li>
<li>A golden thread runs through all the decisions referred to above. A piece of land may be described in the document or decree correctly or wrongly. Description may be given by reference to village, locality, survey number, lekhom number, extent, measurements or boundaries. At times, descriptions may tally pointing unerringly to a particular plot of land in which case there will be no difficulty in locating the plot. Sometimes the various descriptions given in a document or decree may be in conflict with each other. In such a case, the court is called upon to adjudicate on the identity of the exact plot intended to be dealt with in the document or decree. No doubt, the court will at first try to reconcile the various descriptions. If that be not possible, one or more of the descriptions may have to be rejected and the other decision rested only on the other description or descriptions. <span style="text-decoration: underline">When one of the descriptions is vague and uncertain and another description is definite and certain, the latter may be preferred. </span>If none of the descriptions is vague or uncertain, that description which is more certain and stable and least likely to have been mistaken or inserted inadvertently must be preferred if it sufficiently identified the subject matter of the transaction and the other descriptions must be rejected as erroneous or inaccurate. This is not a rule of law and therefore is not inflexible in character; it is a mere rule of construction which appears to be safe and almost an infallible guide.” (Quoted in Chandrakumar vs Narayana Bahuleyan, 2011(3) KLT 185.)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><u>Court cannot look intention when document applies squarely to existing facts</u></strong></p>
<p>Smt. Kamala Devi v. Takhatmal, (1964) 2 SCR 152, dealt with the interpretation of a surety bond. The Court relied upon Sec. 94 of the Indian Evidence Act and found no reason to look for the intention of the parties, since the clear and express words in the bond applied squarely to the existing facts. The Court held as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“Sometimes when it is said that a <span style="text-decoration: underline">Court should look into all the circumstances</span> to find an author’s intention, it is <span style="text-decoration: underline">only for the purpose of finding out whether the words apply accurately to existing facts</span>. But if the words are clear in the context of the surrounding circumstances, the Court <span style="text-decoration: underline">cannot rely on them to attribute to the author an intention</span> contrary to the plain meaning of the words used in the document.” (Quoted in – Anglo American Metallurgical v. MMTC Ltd., <strong>2021-3 SCC 308</strong>)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><u>Sec. 91 and 92 – Best Evidence Rule</u></strong></p>
<p><strong>Sec. 91 </strong>and<strong> 92</strong> provides that when terms of a contract, or of a grant, or of any other disposition of property, have been reduced to the form of a document, and in all cases in which any matter is required by law to be reduced to the form of a document, their <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">terms </span></strong>alone are taken to be the sources of what the parties wished to state; and oral evidence to the contrary, are excluded.</p>
<p>Both Sec. 91 and 92 are based on “best evidence rule”. (Roop Kumar v. Mohan Thadani AIR 2003 SC. 2418: 2003-6  SCC 595; S. Saktivel v. M. Venugopal Pillai 2007-7  SCC 104; Mumbai International Airport v. Golden Chariot Airport, (2012) 10 SCC 422; Tulsi v. Chandrika Prasad, AIR 2006 SC 3359).</p>
<p>The Supreme Court held in <strong>Roop Kumar v. Mohan Thedani</strong>, AIR 2003 SC 2418, as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“The <span style="text-decoration: underline">grounds of exclusion of extrinsic evidence</span> are </li>
<li>(i) to <span style="text-decoration: underline">admit inferior evidence</span> when law requires superior would <span style="text-decoration: underline">amount to nullifying the law</span>, </li>
<li>(ii) when <span style="text-decoration: underline">parties have deliberately put their agreement into writing</span>, it is conclusively presumed, between themselves and their privies, that they intended the writing to form a full and final statement of their intentions, and one which should be <span style="text-decoration: underline">placed beyond the reach of future controversy</span>, bad faith and treacherous memory.”</li>
</ul>
<p>In Bhima Tima Dhotre  v. The Pioneer Chemical Co. (1968) 70 Bom LR 683, it is observed as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“<span style="text-decoration: underline">Documentary evidence becomes meaningless if the writer has to be called in every case to give oral evidence</span> of its contents. If that were the position, it would mean that, in the ultimate analysis, all evidence must be oral and that oral evidence would virtually be the only kind of evidence recognised by law. That, however, is not the position under the Evidence Act. … Section 59 of the said Act enacts that all facts, except the “contents” of documents, may be proved by oral evidence. This provision would clearly indicate that to prove the contents of a document by means of oral evidence would be a violation of that section.”</li>
</ul>
<p>However, oral evidence can be given on a matter (adoption) which is not required by law to be in writing and it is not barred for the mere reason it was contained in a document <em>(</em>Taburi Sahai v. Jhunjhunwala, AIR 1967 SC 106).</p>
<p><strong><u>The word ‘disposition’ is not a ‘term of law’</u></strong></p>
<p>It is observed in Pushpalatha NV v.  V Padma, AIR 2010 Kant 124, that the word ‘disposition’ is not a ‘term of law’.  It is said as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“The term ‘disposition’ has been defined in Stroud’s Judicial Dictionary as a devise ‘intended to comprehend a mode by which property can pass, whether by act of parties or by an act of the law’ and ‘includes transfer and change of property. The word ‘disposition’ means giving away or giving up by a person of something which was his own. It is not a term of law. In has no precise meaning. Its meaning has to be gathered from the context in which it is used. The word ‘disposition’ in relation to property means disposition made by deed or will and also disposition made by or under a decree of a court. The word ‘disposition’ would ordinarily be used in reference to a written document and not to the effect of that document. The removal of a thing from one’s self is involved in a disposal. The disposition is the provision creating the interest, not the interest itself. Therefore, disposition means a plan or arrangement for the disposal, distribution of something; definite settlement with regard to some matter.”</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><u>Patent ambiguity and latent ambiguity</u></strong></p>
<p>Patent ambiguity is that inherent in the words. Extrinsic evidence is inadmissible in such cases.</p>
<p> Sec. 93 and 94 of the Evidence Act deal with cases of patent ambiguity and Sec. 95 to 98 deal with cases of latent ambiguity.</p>

<p><strong><u>“Patent Ambiguity”</u></strong></p>
<p>After referring Smt. Kamala Devi v. Takhatmal, (1964) 2 SCR 152, it is observed in <strong>Anglo American Metallurgical v. MMTC Ltd., 2021-3 SCC 308 </strong>that the principle contained in Sec. 94 of the Evidence Act is that extrinsic evidence is inadmissible in cases of “patent ambiguity”, and that this principle is “fundamental to Indian jurisprudence.”</p>
<p>A “patent ambiguity” is explained in Starkie on Evidence as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“By patent ambiguity must be understood an ambiguity inherent in the words, and incapable of being dispelled, either by any legal rules of construction applied to the instrument itself, or by evidence showing that terms in themselves unmeaning or unintelligible are capable of receiving a known conventional meaning, the great principle on which the rule is founded is that the <span style="text-decoration: underline">intention of parties, should be construed, not by vague evidence of their intentions independently of the expressions which they have thought fit to use</span>, but by the expression themselves. … By patent ambiguity, therefore, must be understood an inherent ambiguity, which cannot be removed, either by the ordinary rules of legal construction or by the application of extrinsic and explanatory evidence, showing that expressions, prima facie, unintelligible, are yet capable of conveying a certain and definite meaning.” (Quoted in – Anglo American Metallurgical v. MMTC Ltd., 2021-3 SCC 308)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><u>“Latent Ambiguity”</u></strong></p>
<p>On the other hand, a “latent ambiguity” is described in Woodroffe and Ali’s Law of Evidence, as follows:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“Latent ambiguity, in the more ordinary application, arises from the existence of facts external to the instrument, and the creation by these facts of a question not solved by the document itself. A latent ambiguity arises when the <span style="text-decoration: underline">words of the instrument are clear, but their application to the circumstances is doubtful</span>; here the <span style="text-decoration: underline">ambiguity, being raised solely by extrinsic evidence, is allowed to be removed by the same means</span>. In strictness of definition, such cases, as those in which peculiar usage may afford a construction to a term different from its natural one as can be seen in s 98, would be instances of latent ambiguity, since the <span style="text-decoration: underline">double use of the term</span> would leave it open to the doubt in <span style="text-decoration: underline">which of its two senses</span> it was to be taken. It is not, however, to this class of cases that reference is now made, but to those in which the ambiguity is rather that of description, either equivocal itself from the existence of two subject matter, or two persons, both falling within its terms as can be seen in s 96, or imperfect when brought to bear on any given person or thing as per ss 95 and 97.” (Quoted in – Anglo American Metallurgical v. MMTC Ltd., 2021-3 SCC 308)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><u>No mention of Price in Contract, but “crucial” emails – Whether Sec. 94 Bar Applies?</u></strong></p>
<p>Though Sec. 94 applies only when a document applies accurately to existing facts, which includes how a particular word is used in a particular sense. Where<span style="text-decoration: underline"> no mention of the price at which coal </span>was to be supplied, and <span style="text-decoration: underline">there were three “crucial” emails,</span> in Anglo American Metallurgical v. MMTC Ltd., 2021-3 SCC 308, it was held as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“These emails must be read as part of the entirety of the correspondence between the parties, which would then make the so-called “admissions” in the aforementioned emails apply to existing facts. Once this is done, it is clear that there is no scope for the <em><u>further application</u></em> of the “patent ambiguity” principle contained in section 94 of the Evidence Act, to the facts of the present case.”</li>
<li>In Anglo American Metallurgical v. MMTC Ltd., 2021-3 SCC 308t it was held to be a latent ambiguity comes under Sec. 95 of the Evidence Act, read with proviso (6) and illustration (f) to Sec. 92; and therefore, evidence can be led to show the peculiar sense of such language. It is pointed out that this approach is reflected in a recent judgment of this Court in Transmission Corpn. of Andhra Pradesh Ltd. v. GMR Vemagiri Power Generation Ltd., (2018) 3 SCC 716, where it was observed as under:</li>
<li>“21. In the event of any ambiguity arising, the terms of the contract will have to be interpreted by taking into consideration all surrounding facts and circumstances, including correspondence exchanged, to arrive at the real intendment of the parties, and not what one of the parties may contend subsequently to have been the intendment or to say as included afterwards, as observed in Bank of India v. K. Mohandas [Bank of India v. K. Mohandas, (2009) 5 SCC 313] : (SCC p. 328, para 28)</li>
<li>“28. The true construction of a contract must depend upon the import of the words used and not upon what the parties choose to say afterwards. Nor does subsequent conduct of the parties in the performance of the contract affect the true effect of the clear and unambiguous words used in the contract. <span style="text-decoration: underline">The intention of the parties must be ascertained from the language they have used, considered in the light of the surrounding circumstances</span> and the object of the contract. The nature and purpose of the contract is an important guide in ascertaining the intention of the parties.”” (page 727).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><u>Admission of Contents of Document in Pleadings</u></strong></p>
<p>In Perumal Chettiar v. Kamakshi Ammal, AIR 1938 Mad 785, (1938) 2 MLJ 189, it is observed, as to pleadings, as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“The result, in India, is that if by reason of the document being <span style="text-decoration: underline">unstamped,</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline">no evidence of its contents </span>whether primary or secondary is admissible, evidence of admissions by the defendant is equally inadmissible. The <span style="text-decoration: underline">position may be different where admissions are made in the pleadings </span>themselves (cf. Huddleston v, Briscoe (1805) 11 Ves. 583 (596) : 32 E.R. 1215 (1220) and Thynne v. Protheroe (1814) 2 M. &amp; S. 553 : 105 E.R. 488), <span style="text-decoration: underline">because by reason of Section 58 of the Evidence Act</span>, it may not be necessary to prove admitted facts and the objection under <span style="text-decoration: underline">Section 91 will not arise unless the plaintiff is called upon to go into evidence.</span> (Mallappa v. Mat an Naga Chetty (1918) 35 M.L.J. 555 : I.L.R. 42 Mad. 41 (F.B.)) </li>
<li>This was the position in Pramatha Nath Sandal v. Dwarka Nath Dey (1896) I.L.R. 23 Cal. 851;<span style="text-decoration: underline"> cf. however</span> Chenbasappa v. Lakshman Ramchandra (1893) I.L.R. 18 Bom. 369, where it was suggested that in a suit on an unstamped <span style="text-decoration: underline">promissory note, even an admission in the written statement may not avail </span>the plaintiff, as the Court when giving a decree on such admission may be “acting on” the document within the meaning of Section 35 of the Stamp Act; see also Ankur Chunder Roy Chowdhry v. Madhub Chunder Gkose (1873) 21 W.R. 1.”</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><u>Irreconcilable inconsistency between two specific clauses</u></strong></p>
<p>In case of documents like sale deeds, gift deeds, mortgage deeds also, if the apparently appearing inconsistency can be reconciled, the court will take that recourse. </p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>But, if the <span style="text-decoration: underline">inconsistency is irreconcilable</span>, the earlier or the subsequent part or specific clauses, the <span style="text-decoration: underline">earlier part will prevail over the latter</span>; but, in case of a <span style="text-decoration: underline">Will, latter part will prevail, </span>under Sec. 88 of the Succession Act. (Uma Devi Nambiar v. T.C. Sidhan, (2004) 2 SCC 321.)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><u>Interpretation of Contracts</u></strong></p>
<p>In Provash Chandra Dalui v. Biswanath Banerjee, 1989 Supp (1) SCC 487, it is observed as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>” ‘Ex praecedentibus et consequentibus optima fit inter-pretatio.’</li>
<li>The best interpretation is made from the context. Every contract is to be construed with reference to its object and the whole of its terms. The whole context must be considered to ascertain the intention of the parties. It is an accepted principle of construction that the sense and meaning of the parties in any particular part of instrument may be collected ‘ex antecedentibus et consequentibus;’ every part of it may be brought into action in order to collect from the whole one uniform and consistent sense, if that is possible.</li>
<li>As Lord Davey said in N.E. Railway v. Hastings, [1900] A.C. 260 (267),</li>
<li>“The deed must be read as a whole in order to ascertain the true meaning of its several clauses, and the words of each clause should be so interpreted as to bring them into harmony with the other provisions of the deed if that interpretation does no violence to the meaning of which they are naturally susceptible.”</li>
<li>In construing a contract the Court must look at the words used in the contract unless they are such that one may suspect that they do not convey the intention correctly. <span style="text-decoration: underline">If the words are clear, there is very little the Court can do about it.</span> In the construction of a written instrument it is legitimate in order to ascertain the true meaning of the words used and if that be doubtful it is legitimate to have regard to the circumstances surrounding their creation and the subject matter to which it was designed and intended they should apply.”</li>
</ul>
<p>In Bharat Coking Coal Ltd. v. AMR Dev Prabha 2020 SCC OnLine SC 335, it is pointed out that ‘it must be noted that judicial interpretation of contracts in the sphere of commerce stands on a distinct footing than while interpreting statutes’. (Quoted in: <strong>Agmatel India Private Limited v. M/S Resoursys Telecom AIR 2022 SC 1103</strong>)</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Contractual interpretation ought not to have been grounds for the Constitutional Court (High Court) (See: Bharat Coking Coal Ltd. v. AMR Dev Prabha, 2020 SCC OnLine SC 335; Agmatel India Private Limited v. M/S Resoursys Telecom, AIR 2022 SC 1103)</li>
</ul>
<p><u>Tender – If two interpretations possible, the interpretation of the author be accepted</u>: In Silppi Constructions Contractors v. Union of India, 2019 SCC OnLine SC 1133, it is held as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“The authority floating the tender is the best judge of its requirements and, therefore, the court’s interference should be minimal. The authority which floats the contract or tender, and has authored the tender documents is the best judge as to how the documents have to be interpreted. If two interpretations are possible then the interpretation of the author must be accepted. The courts will only interfere to prevent arbitrariness, irrationality, bias, mala fides or perversity. With this approach in mind we shall deal with the present case.” . (Quoted in: <strong>Agmatel India Private Limited v. M/S Resoursys Telecom AIR 2022 SC 1103</strong>)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><u>Tenders or Award of Contracts</u></strong></p>
<p>In Jagdish Mandal v. State of Orissa, (2007) 14 SCC 517, our Apex Court observed as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“22. Judicial review of administrative action is intended to prevent arbitrariness, irrationality, unreasonableness, bias and mala fides. Its purpose is to check whether choice or decision is made “lawfully” and not to check whether choice or decision is “sound”. When the power of judicial review is invoked in matters relating to tenders or award of contracts, certain special features should be borne in mind. A contract is a commercial transaction. Evaluating tenders and awarding contracts are essentially commercial functions. Principles of equity and natural justice stay at a distance. If the decision relating to award of contract is bona fide and is in public interest, courts will not, in exercise of power of judicial review, interfere even if a procedural aberration or error in assessment or prejudice to a tenderer, is made out. The power of judicial review will not be permitted to be invoked to protect private interest at the cost of public interest, or to decide contractual disputes. The tenderer or contractor with a grievance can always seek damages in a civil court. .. A court before interfering in tender or contractual matters in exercise of power of judicial review, should pose to itself the following questions:</li>
<li>(i) Whether the process adopted or decision made by the authority is mala fide or intended to favour someone; or Whether the process adopted or decision made is so arbitrary and irrational that the court can say:“the decision is such that no responsible authority acting reasonably and in accordance with relevant law could have reached”;</li>
<li>(ii) Whether public interest is affected.</li>
<li>If the answers are in the negative, there should be no interference under Article 226. Cases involving blacklisting or imposition of penal consequences on a tenderer/contractor or distribution of State largesse (allotment of sites/shops, grant of licences, dealerships and franchises) stand on a different footing as they may require a higher degree of fairness in action.” (Quoted in: Agmatel India Private Limited v. M/S Resoursys Telecom AIR 2022 SC 1103)</li>

<p>Orbiter dicta of SC binding on High Courts in the absence of a direct pronouncement. The Supreme Court in Oriental Insurance Company Limited v. Meena Variyal ((2007) 5 SCC 428) emphasised as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“An obiter dictum of this Court may be binding only on the High Courts in the absence of a direct pronouncement on that question elsewhere by this Court. But as far as this Court is concerned, though not binding, it does have clear persuasive authority.”</li>
