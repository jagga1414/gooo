<p><strong><u>Foreign Divorce Judgment:</u></strong></p>
<p> Sec. 13 of the Civil Procedure Code lays down the provision as to the applicability of the foreign judgment.  From Sec. 13 of the CPC it is clear –</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>For the foreign judgment to be ‘conclusive’, it must have been  
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>passed by a court having competent jurisdiction,  </li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline">g</span>iven the verdict on merits  and</li>
<li>observing natural justice.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Sec. 13 reads as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“13. <strong><em><u>When foreign judgment</u> <u>not conclusive</u></em></strong>—A foreign judgment shall be conclusive as to any matter thereby directly adjudicated upon between the same parties or between parties under whom they or any of them claim litigating under the same title except—<ul><li>(a) where it has not been pronounced by a court of competent jurisdiction;</li></ul><ul><li>(b) where it has not been given on the merits of the case;</li></ul><ul><li>(c) where it appears on the fact of the proceedings to be founded on an incorrect view of international law or a refusal to recognise the law of India in cases in which such law is applicable;</li></ul><ul><li>(d) where the proceedings in which the judgment was obtained are opposed to natural justice;</li></ul><ul><li>(e) where it has been obtained by fraud;</li></ul>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>(f) where it sustains a claim founded on a breach of any law in force in India.”</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><u>Competent <strong>Court</strong></u></strong> <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">– Decree  ‘in accordance with the matrimonial law’</span></strong> </p>
<p>For accepting a foreign judgment as valid, it should have been passed by a ‘competent court’ according to S. 13(a). What is court of competent jurisdiction is not explained in the CPC.  Our Apex Court held in Y. Narasimharao v. Y. Venkatalexmi, 1991-3 SCC 451, that the general rule is that the decree passed must have been ‘<span style="text-decoration: underline">in accordance with the matrimonial law under which the parties are married</span>’.  </p>
<p><strong><u>Court of Competent Jurisdiction</u></strong> <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">– </span></strong> <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">Three E</span><span style="text-decoration: underline"><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>xceptions</strong></span></span></strong></p>
<p>In Y. Narasimharao v. Y. Venkatalexmi, 1991-3 SCC 451, the Supreme Court laid down following <span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>three exceptions</strong></span> to the general rule that ‘decree passed must have been in accordance with the matrimonial law under which the parties are married’.  They are –</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong> (i) </strong>where the matrimonial action is filed in the <strong>forum where the respondent is domiciled </strong>or habitually and permanently resides <strong>and</strong> the relief is granted on a <strong><u>ground available</u> in the matrimonial law</strong> under which the parties are married;</li>
<li><strong>(ii) </strong>where the respondent voluntarily and effectively <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">submits to the jurisdiction</span></strong> of the forum as discussed above <strong><u>and</u> </strong>contests the claim which is based on a <strong><u>ground available</u></strong> under the matrimonial law under which the parties are married;</li>
<li><strong>(iii) </strong>where the respondent <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">consents</span></strong> to the grant of the relief although the jurisdiction of the forum is not in accordance with the provisions of the matrimonial law of the parties.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the light of S. 13 of the CPC, read with the observations of Y. Narasimharao v. Y. Venkatalexmi, 1991-3 SCC 451, <span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>even when</strong></span> a foreign <span style="text-decoration: underline">divorce decree is granted <em>by a forum</em>, jurisdiction of which is <em>not in</em> <em>accordance with the provisions of the matrimonial law</em></span>,  it is accepted as valid in India, if the decree is passed on any one of the circumstances that invite the exemption <strong>(ii) </strong>or <strong>(iii).</strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline"><span style="text-decoration: underline">Consented Decree</span></span></strong> – <span><b><u> Non-compliance of Provisions of Matrimonial Law, </u></b></span><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">Immaterial </span></strong> </p>
<p>In Augustine Kalathil Mathew v.

<p><em><strong><u><em><strong><u>JURISDICTION OF FORUM IN ACCORDANCE WITH PROVISIONS OF MATRIMONIAL LAW</u></strong></em></u></strong></em></p>
<p>To determine whether the Foreign Court was a forum having jurisdiction ‘in accordance with the matrimonial law’ we have to look into the the ‘Marriage Laws’ applicable in India and the ‘Grounds’ stated therein for judicial actions.</p>
<p><strong><u>Marriage Acts Applies to Christians</u></strong></p>
<p>Following are the Marriage Acts that applies to Christians in India-</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Indian Christian Marriage Act, 1872</li>
<li>Cochin Christian Civil Marriage Act, 1920</li>
<li>Special Marriage Act, 1954</li>
<li>The Foreign Marriage Act, 1969</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><u>Indian Christian Marriage Act, 1872</u></strong><strong></strong></p>
<p>The Indian Christian Marriage Act, 1872 applies to ‘Indian Christians’. According to the definition of the Act ‘Indian Christians’ ‘includes the Christian descendants of natives of India converted to Christianity, as well as such converts’.</p>
<p><strong><u>Law Applicable to Christians in Manipur and Erstwhile Travancore- Area of Kerala</u></strong></p>
<p>The Indian Christian Marriage Act, 1872 is not applicable to Christians in erstwhile Travancore- area of Kerala, and Manipur, even now. The marriage law applicable to Cochin area of Kerala State was the Cochin Christian Civil Marriage Act, 1920.</p>
<p>In these parts customary rules and personal laws (e.g. Canon for Catholics) hold the field. The area of erstwhile Travancore, now stands included in Tamil Nadu is governed by the Indian Christian Marriage Act because of the enactment of the Indian Christian Marriage (Extension to Transferred Territory) Act, 1995.</p>
<p><strong><u>Special Marriage Act, 1954</u></strong></p>
<p>The Special Marriage Act, 1954 enables the citizens of India, irrespective of religion, to have their marriage registered for civil recognition.  Marriages solemnized under this Act are not governed by their personal laws. The act lays down the qualifications for the parties to the marriage and it also deals with restitution of conjugal rights, Judicial separation, divorce, custody of children, etc.  </p>
<p>It specifies that Indian Succession Act governs succession of the parties to the Special Marriage.  But, Hindu Succession Act applies to Hindu, Buddhist, Sikh or Jain as regards the succession.</p>
<p>Sec. 15 of the Act allows to register marriages conducted in other forms. It reads as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“15. <strong><u>Registration of marriages celebrated in other forms</u></strong>―Any marriage celebrated, whether before or after the commencement of this Act, other than a marriage solemnized under the Special Marriage Act, 1872 (3 of 1872), or under this Act, may be registered under this Chapter by a Marriage Officer in the territories to which this Act extends if the following conditions are fulfilled, namely―

<p>It is noticeable that the matters relating to divorce, nullity of marriage, judicial separation, restitution of conjugal rights, etc. of the Christians, except those who had married under the Special Marriage Act, are governed under the Indian Divorce Act, 1869.</p>
<p><strong><u>The Foreign Marriage Act, 1969</u></strong></p>
<p>The Central Government  appoints Marriage Officers in foreign countries under the Foreign Marriage Act, 1969. The Act provides for conditions and procedures relating to solemnization and registration of foreign marriages.</p>
<p>By virtue of Sec. 18 of the Foreign Marriage Act, succession to property, restitution of conjugal rights, judicial separation, determination of void and voidable marriages, legitimacy of children, divorce, various judicial proceedings, etc. of the parties married under the Foreign Marriage Act is governed under the respective provisions of the Special Marriage Act, 1954</p>
