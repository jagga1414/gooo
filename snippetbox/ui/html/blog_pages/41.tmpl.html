<p><strong>1. <span style="text-decoration: underline">Kale v. Deputy Director of Consolidation</span></strong>,<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline"> the <mark class="has-inline-color has-primary-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">leading decision</mark></span></strong></p>
<p>It is held in Kale v. Deputy Director of Consolidation, 1976-3 SCC 119, as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“10. In other words to put the binding effect and <span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>the essentials</strong></span> of a family settlement in a concretized form, the matter may be reduced into the form of the following propositions:</li>
<li>.(1) The family settlement <span style="text-decoration: underline">must be a bona fide one</span> so as <span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>to resolve </strong>family <strong>disputes</strong></span> and rival claims by a <span style="text-decoration: underline">fair and <strong>equitable division</strong></span> or allotment of properties between the various members of the family;</li>
<li>.(2) The said settlement <span style="text-decoration: underline">must be <strong>voluntary</strong></span> and should not be induced by fraud, coercion or undue influence;</li>
<li>.(3) The family arrangements <span style="text-decoration: underline">may be even <strong>oral</strong></span> in which case no registration is necessary;</li>
<li>.(4) It is well settled that <span style="text-decoration: underline">registration would be necessary only if </span>the terms of the family arrangement are <span style="text-decoration: underline">reduced into writing.</span> Here also, <span style="text-decoration: underline">a distinction </span>should be made between a document containing the terms and recitals of a family arrangement made under the document and <span style="text-decoration: underline">a <strong>mere memorandum </strong>prepared after the family arrangement </span>had already been made either for the purpose of the record or for information of the Court for making necessary mutation. <span style="text-decoration: underline">In such a case the memorandum itself does</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline">not create or extinguish any rights in immoveable properties </span>and therefore does not <span style="text-decoration: underline">fall within the mischief of Section </span>17(2) [Section 17(1)(b)?] of the <strong>Registration</strong> Act and is, therefore, <strong>not compulsorily</strong> registrable;</li>
<li>.(5) The members who may be parties to the family arrangement must have <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">some antecedent title</span>,</strong> claim or interest even a possible claim in the property which is acknowledged by the parties to the settlement. Even if one of the parties to the settlement has no title but under the arrangement the other party relinquishes all its claims or titles in favour of such a person and acknowledges him to be the sole owner, then the <span style="text-decoration: underline">antecedent title must be assumed</span> and the f<span style="text-decoration: underline">amily arrangement will be upheld</span>, and the Courts will find no difficulty in giving assent to the same;</li>
<li>.(6) Even if <span style="text-decoration: underline">bona fide disputes</span>, present or possible, which may not involve legal claims <span style="text-decoration: underline">are settled</span> by a bona fide family arrangement which is fair and equitable the family arrangement is final and<span style="text-decoration: underline"> <strong>binding </strong>on the parties</span> to the settlement.” ( Quoted in: K Arumuga Velaiah v. P R Ramasamy, 2023-3 SCC 757)</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally it was held as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“We would, therefore, return the reference with a statement of the following general propositions:
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>With reference to the first question:</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>(1) A family arrangement can be made orally.</li>
<li>(2) If made orally, there being no document, no question of registration arises.
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>With reference to the second question:</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>(3) If though it could have been made orally, it was in fact reduced to the form of a “document”, registration (when the value is Rs. 100 and upwards) is necessary.</li>
<li>(4) Whether the terms have been “reduced to the form of a document” is a question of fact in each case to be determined upon a consideration of the nature and phraseology of the writing and the circumstances in which and the purpose with which it was written.</li>
<li>(5) If the terms were not “reduced to the form of a document”, registration was not necessary ( even though the value is Rs. 100 or upwards); and, while the writing cannot be used as a document of title, it can be used as a piece of evidence for what it may be worth, e.g., as corroborative of other evidence or as an admission of the transaction or as showing or explaining conduct.</li>
<li>(6) If the terms were “reduced to the form of a document” and, though the value was Rs. 100 or upwards, it was not registered, the absence of registration makes the document inadmissible in evidence and is fatal to proof of the arrangement embodied in the document.
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>With reference to the third question:</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>(7) Where it has been found that there is not legally binding oral family arrangement, or that the arrangement, though reduced to writing with the intention that the document should be the document of title, cannot be proved for want of registration, and where no question of estoppel arises, the mere facts that mutation has taken place and that possession has been taken cannot remedy, by virtue of what is known to English law as the doctrine of “part performance”, the absence of registration.”</li>

<p>It is held in <span style="text-decoration: underline">Kale v. Deputy Director of Consolidation</span>, 1976-3 SCC 119, as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“The principle that there is <span style="text-decoration: underline">no estoppel against the statute does not apply</span> to the present case. Assuming, however, that the said document was compulsorily registrable the Courts have generally held that a family <span style="text-decoration: underline">arrangement being binding</span> on the parties to it would operate as an <span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>estoppel</strong></span> by preventing the parties <span style="text-decoration: underline">after having <strong>t</strong></span><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>aken advantage</strong></span> under the arrangement to resile from the same or try to revoke it.” (quoted and followed in Ravinder Kaur Grewal and Ors. v.

<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“This Court has also clearly laid down that a<span style="text-decoration: underline"> family arrangement being bindin</span>g on the parties to the arrangement clearly <span style="text-decoration: underline">operates as an </span><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">estoppel</span> </strong>so as to preclude any of the parties <span style="text-decoration: underline">who have taken advantage</span> under the agreement from revoking or challenging the same.” (followed in K Arumuga Velaiah v.

<p><strong>3. <span style="text-decoration: underline">“Family” be understood in a wider sense </span></strong></p>
<p>In Khushi Ram v. Nawal Singh, AIR 2021 SC 1117, it is observed as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“23. A Three Judge Bench in the <span style="text-decoration: underline">celebrated judgment</span> of this Court in kale and Ors. Vs. deputy director of Consolidation and Ors., (1976) 3 SCC 119, had elaborately considered all contours of the family settlement. This Court laid down that term “family” has to be understood in a <span style="text-decoration: underline">wider sense</span> so as to include within its fold <span style="text-decoration: underline">not only close relations or legal heirs but even those persons who may have some sort of antecedent title</span>, a semblance of a claim or even if they have a spes successionis.”</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>4. <span style="text-decoration: underline">Does <u>Family Arrangement</u> Requires <mark class="has-inline-color has-primary-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Registration </mark></span></strong></p>
<p>It is further held in K Arumuga Velaiah v. P R Ramasamy, 2023-3 SCC 757 as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“Ultimately, this Court held (in Kale v. Deputy Director of Consolidation) that the family arrangement in the nature of a compromise which was considered in that case <span style="text-decoration: underline">did not require registration</span>. It was further held that since the existence of the family arrangement was admitted in that case, the same was binding on the principle of estoppel. Also, even if the family arrangement could not be registered it could be <span style="text-decoration: underline">used for collateral purpose</span>, i.e. to show the nature and character of possession of the parties in pursuance of the family settlement and also for the purpose of applying the rule of <span style="text-decoration: underline">estoppel</span> which flowed from the conduct of the parties, who, having taken benefit under the settlement for seven years, later tried to resile from the settlement.”</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, on the facts of the case, referring previous decisions<mark class="has-inline-color has-primary-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><sup>[#]</sup></mark> it is held in<strong> K Arumuga Velaiah v. P R Ramasamy, 2023-3 SCC 757 </strong>as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“On a perusal of the award which is in the form of a resolution, it is clear that there was <span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>no right created</strong> in any specific item</span> or asset of the joint family properties in any person but the parties resolved to take certain actions <span style="text-decoration: underline">in pursuance of a family arrangement</span>. Therefore under Annexure P­10 (Ex. B­13) there was no right created in favour of any party in any specific item of joint family property. The said document which has been styled as an award is, in our view, only a memorandum of understanding/family arrangement to be acted upon in future. Hence, in our considered view, the said document did not create rights in specific properties or assets of the family, in favour of specific persons. Therefore, the same <span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>did not require registration</strong> under section 17(1)(e) </span>of the Act. The said document was in the nature of a document envisaged under section 17(2)(v) of the Act.”
