<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">Who is the OWNER of Exempted (Leasehold) Plantation Lands in Kerala?</span></strong></p>
<p>It is <strong>Government itself,</strong> though by virtue of Chapter II (Sec. 13) of the Kerala Land Reforms Act, 1964, the tenant has ‘Fixity’. Reasonings:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>1. <strong><u>Plantation (lease) lands VEST in GOVT, automatically</u></strong></li>
<li>Because,</li>
<li>Sec. 72 provides for-

</ul>
</li>
<li>2. <strong> ‘<span style="text-decoration: underline">Vesting’ in Govt. is ‘Vesting of Ownership</span></strong>‘</li>
<li>It is for the reasons –






























<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><span style="font-family: var(--list--font-family);background-color: var(--global--color-background);color: var(--global--color-foreground);font-size: var(--global--font-size-root)">Declared to be ‘vested’ in Government (Sec. 72).</span></li>

</ul>
</li>
<li>3.<span style="text-decoration: underline"> <strong>‘Exemption’ in Chapter III Cannot be read into Sec. 72B(2)</strong></span></li>
<li>Sec. 72B(2) specifies that the provisions of Section 82 (as to ceiling limit) shall apply for a limited purpose. It reads-<ul><li>(2) The <span style="text-decoration:underline">provisions of Section 82 shall</span>, so far as may be, <strong><mark class="has-inline-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#cf2e2e"><span style="text-decoration:underline">apply</span> <span style="text-decoration:underline">to the calculation of the ceiling area</span></mark></strong> for the purposes of the proviso to Sub-section (1)</li></ul></li>
<li>The exemption provision (that exempts plantation lands etc. from ceiling limit) in Sec. 81 (Chapter III) cannot be brought-forth or read-into Sec. 72B (provision for assignment/purchase-certificate) in Chapter II.</li>
<li>Because, 
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Proviso to Sec. 72B(1) shows – Sec. 72B(1) is an an independent provision. (It says as to assignment to a cultivating tenant within the ceiling limits.)  </li>
<li>When a provision (here, ceiling limit in Sec. 82) in Chapter III is referred in a section in another Chapter (here, Sec. 72B), <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">to state the limit in area</span></strong>, it cannot be said – the colour or smell reflected on the first provision (here, Sec. 82), by virtue of another section (here, Sec. 81, the exemption provision) is reflected also on the latter section (here, Sec. 72B).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Further:
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Chapter II of the KLR Act (dealing with ‘Tenancy’) is exclusive and exhaustive as to ‘fixity’, and ‘vesting’ of land in Government.</li>
<li>It is not stated anywhere in the Act – the right and title of the (leased-plantation) land vested in Government under Sec. 72, will be divested in any manner (to the previous owner, or to the tenant or to anybody else), in any circumstance.</li>
<li>Sec. 72E provides for collection of ‘<strong>rent</strong>‘ from the holders of the plantation. It is for the reason that (ownership of) the land vests in Govt. </li>
<li>Proceedings initiated by Taluk Land Board under Chapter III (in respect of plantation) do not confer title.</li>

<ul class="wp-block-list">

<p><strong><u>Apportionment depends upon rights on the date of acquisition</u></strong></p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Valia Raja v. Veeraraghava Iyer, 1961 Ker LT 103, it was held that the question of apportionment of compensation has to depend upon the rights of the parties on the date of the acquisition. Referred to in: Varkey Thomas Vs. Annamma Abraham,  1969 Ker LT 903.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><u>Glen Leven Estate (P) Ltd. v. State of Kerala, 2022-6 Ker LT 439</u></strong></p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>In Glen Leven Estate (P) Ltd. v. State of Kerala, 2022-6 Ker LT 439, the question as to ‘rival claims raised by the cultivating tenant and landlord for compensation on acquisition’ arose. The land was leased out by landlords. The lease-rights came in the cultivating tenants by transfer. The Government contended that the tenant was a cultivating tenant and the land vested upon the Govt. under Sec. 72 KLR Act. Hence tenant alone would be entitled to get compensation for the improvements to be determined under the Kerala Compensation for Tenants Improvements Act, 1958, in view of Section 20(1) of the KLR Act.</li>
<li>The landlords argued that the land was a plantation (over 30 acres) when it was (originally) leased, and therefore, they are entitled to claim exemption and benefits in the light of the exemption under clause (viii)  of Section 3 (1) of the KLR Act. Since there would be no fixity of tenure, it being a plantation, there would not be vesting of rights of the land owner in the Government. Hence, there should be the apportionment of the compensation between the lessor and the lessee and it should be decided in the acquisition proceedings.</li>
<li>The single Judge dismissed the writ petition, ‘leaving open the liberty of the lessee as well as the landlords, to approach the civil court seeking relief against the Government, and also to resolve the inter se dispute by and between the tenant and the landlords’.</li>
<li>The Division Bench, in appeal held that ‘land acquisition’ proceedings are to be initiated. It is pointed out that (even if it is a land vested in Govt.) there is no provision in Sec. 72 for ‘resuming’ if and when Govt. need it. The court also observed as under –<ul><li>“31. On an analysis of the provisions of Section 72(1) of the Act, 1963, it is clear that when the Government notified the said provision with effect from 01.01.1970, all right, title and interest of the landowners and intermediaries in respect of holdings held by cultivating tenants (including holders of kudiyirippus and holders karaimas) entitled to fixity of tenure under Section 13, and in respect of which certificates of purchase under sub-Section (2) of Section 59 have not been issued, vested in the Government.</li></ul><ul><li>32. Therefore, it is clear from Section 72 that what is vested with the Government is the right, title and interest of the land owners and intermediaries in respect of the holdings held by the cultivating tenants. It is nothing but a legal fiction by which the interest held by a cultivating tenant in a property of a landlord or intermediary is protected from 01.01.1970 .</li></ul><ul><li>34. On a conjoint reading of Sections 72 and 72A, it can be seen that vesting of rights in the Government contained under Section 72 is the rights held by the landlord and the intermediary in respect of holdings held by the cultivating tenants. However, the same will not, in any manner, interfere with the rights enjoyed by a cultivating tenant in contemplation of the provisions of the Act, 1963.”</li></ul>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>42. Therefore, we have no doubt in our mind to hold that Section 72 of Act, 1963 would only deal with the right, title and interest of the land owners and intermediaries in respect of the holdings held by the cultivating tenants free from encumbrances created by the land owners and intermediaries. However, the legal provisions discussed above would make it clear that insofar as the cultivating tenant is concerned, an absolute right is vested with him to seek assignment subject to the payment of purchase price in contemplation of Section 72D of the Act, 1963.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>While considering the right of landlord, it is pointed out (basing on the principle, or scheme of the KLR Act<strong><mark class="has-inline-color has-primary-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">*<sup>*</sup></mark></strong>) that the landlord may have right for compensation under Section 72BB. The Division Bench said-<ul><li>“36. So also, sub-Section (1) of Section 72BB dealing with ‘the right of landlord to apply for assignment and compensation’ specifies that any landowner or intermediary, whose right, title and interest in respect of any holding have vested in the Government, may apply to the Land Tribunal for the assignment of such right, title and interest to the cultivating tenant and for the payment of the compensation due to him under Section 72A.”</li></ul></li>
