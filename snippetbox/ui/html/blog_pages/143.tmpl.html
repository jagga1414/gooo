</ul>
<p><strong><u>PROOF – Two Types</u></strong></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline">First, <strong>Formal Proof:</strong> Proof as to existence of the document</span>. The modes of proof of documents are governed under Sec. 64 to 73A of the Evidence Act.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline">Second, </span><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">Substantive Proof</span>:<span style="text-decoration: underline"> </span></strong><span style="text-decoration: underline"> Proof as to truth of the contents document</span>. Besides the formal proof, in most cases (excepting a few cases where signature, hand-writing etc. alone are considered), the court acts upon a document, only when truth of the same is established.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, proof as to truth of a document is to be established-</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>(i) by oral evidence of one who can vouchsafe the same,</li>
<li>(ii) by circumstantial evidence,</li>
<li>(iii) by invoking presumption or</li>
<li>(iv) by express admission by the other side.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><u>Modes of Proof of Documents</u></strong></p>
<p>Proof of Documents (as to, both, ‘formal proof’ and ‘truth of the contents’) can be established invoking one of the following Modes:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Admission of the person who wrote or signed the document (Sec. 17, 21, 58, 67, 70).</li>
<li>Evidence of a person in whose presence the document was signed or written – ocular evidence (Sec. 59).</li>
<li>An attesting witness (Sec. 59).</li>
<li>Opinion of a person who is acquainted with the writing of the person who signed or wrote (Sec. 47).</li>
<li>Admission made by the person who signed or wrote the document made in judicial proceedings (Sec. 32, 33).</li>
<li>Evidence of a handwriting expert or other opinion/scientific-evidence (Sec.45).</li>
<li>Evidence of a person who, in routine, has been receiving the document; or a document signed by such a person in the ordinary course of his business or official duty, though he may have never seen the author signing the document (Sec. 32, 34, 35 or 114).</li>
<li>Invoking (specific) presumptions under Sec. 79 to 90A.</li>
<li>Presumptions (general) under Sec. 114.</li>
<li>Circumstantial evidence: on probability or inferences (Sec. 114).</li>
<li>Court-comparison (Sec. 73).</li>
<li>Facts judicially noticeable (Sec. 56 and 57).</li>
<li>A fact of <strong><u>common-knowledge</u></strong>. (It does not require proof. See: Union Of India v. Virendra Bharti: 2011-2 ACC 886, 2010  ACJ 2353; Rakhal Chakraborty v. Sanjib Kumar Roy: 1998-1 GauLR 253, 1997-2 GauLT 705)</li>
<li>Internal evidence afforded by the contents of the document; a link in a chain of correspondence; evidence of recipient of the documen<em>t. </em>(Mobarik Ali Ahmed v. State of Bombay, AIR 1957 SC 857)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><u>Production, Admissibility &amp; Proof of Documents</u></strong></p>
<p>A document to be used in court has to pass through three steps. They are:</p>
<ol class="wp-block-list" start="1">
<li>Production of documents in court</li>
<li>Admittance and exhibition</li>
<li>Proof (formal proof and truth of contents).</li>
</ol>
<p><strong><u>ADMISSIBILITY of Documents – Objection</u></strong>– 2 counts</p>
<p>Disputes on admissibility of documents arise on 2 domains. (See: <strong>Manakishore Lalbhai v. New Era Fabrics</strong>: AIR 2015 SC 3796)</p>
<ol class="wp-block-list" start="1">
<li>document which is ab initio (or inherently) ‘inadmissible’</li>
<li>document liable to be objected on ‘mode or manner of proof’.</li>
</ol>
<p>Even if an inherently-inadmissible document is marked, objections thereto can be raised ‘at a later stage’. Mode of proof (not inherent admissibility) falls within the realm of procedural law. Therefore, objection thereto can be waived.</p>
<p><strong><u>Inherently-Inadmissible Documents</u></strong></p>
<p>‘Inherent-inadmissibility of documents’ arises from the following:</p>
<ol class="wp-block-list" start="1">
<li>Irrelevancy</li>
<li>Non-registration.</li>
</ol>
<p>Section 5 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 deals with relevancy. It reads as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“5. <span style="text-decoration: underline">Evidence may be given of facts in issue and relevant facts</span> — Evidence may be given in any suit or proceedings of the existence or non-existence of every fact in issue and of such other facts as are hereinafter declared to be relevant, and of no others.”</li>
</ul>
<p>In Jainab Bibi Saheb v. Hyderally Saheb, (1920) 38 MLJ 532, it was pointed out that neither an omission by an advocate to object to giving of irrelevant and inadmissible evidence nor the failure of the tribunal to exclude it of its own motion would validate a decree based on material which the Evidence Act declares to be inherently and in substance irrelevant to the issue. It was also held in this decision that the primary rule to prove relevant facts by the evidence of witnesses is to call them before the trial Judge and examine them viva voce in the manner stated in Chapter 10 of the Evidence Act.</p>
<p><strong><u>Document Liable to be Objected on ‘Mode or Manner of Proof’</u></strong></p>
<p>Following are <em>improper</em> modes (liable to objection):</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Seeking exhibition through one who cannot vouchsafe veracity or truth.</li>
<li>Objectionable (mode of) secondary evidence. Eg:
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Certified copy produced without proving circumstances that entitles to give secondary evidence under Sec. 65 of the Evd. Act.</li>
<li>Secondary evidence other than that is recognised under Sec. 63.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Unstamped or insufficiently/improperly stamped document.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">Whether P</span><u><span style="text-decoration: underline">roof of Admitted Documents Includes ‘Truth’ of its Contents</span></u></strong></p>
<p>Sec. 58 of the Evidence Act says that ‘Admitted facts need not be proved’. Order VIII, Rule 5 CPC stipulates that every allegation of fact in the plaint, if not denied specifically or by necessary implication, shall be taken to be admitted except as against a person under disability.</p>
<p>Effect of marking a document without formal proof (on admission or without objection) brings-about divergent views.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-table is-style-regular"><table><tbody><tr><td>First view</td><td>Admission of contents; and, it dispenses with proof as to truth. (It is on the proposition that <span style="text-decoration: underline">proof includes ‘truth of contents’</span>.)</td></tr><tr><td>Second View</td><td>Admission of contents; but, it does <span style="text-decoration: underline">not dispense with proof</span> (as to both ‘existence’ and ‘truth’).</td></tr><tr><td>Third view</td><td>If <em><u>truth is in issue</u></em>, mere proof of contents, or marking without objection, is not proof of truth.</td></tr><tr><td>Fourth view</td><td>Admission of contents of a document may dispense with proof (as to both ‘existence’ and ‘truth’); but its <strong><em><u>PROBATIVE VALUE</u></em></strong> will be a matter for the court, and the proof as to truth is left to the <span style="text-decoration: underline">discretion of the court</span>.  In proper cases court can presume truth.</td></tr><tr><td>Fifth view</td><td>Court should <em><u><mark class="has-inline-color has-primary-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><strong>require</strong></mark></u></em> the party producing the document to adduce proper evidence, and to cure formal defects.</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>
<p><strong><u>Objection to be Raised When Document is Admitted; Otherwise, Opportunity Lost</u></strong> </p>
<p>It was observed by the Supreme Court in 2001 in Bipin Shantilal Panchal v. State of Gujarat, AIR 2001 SC 1158, that that ‘it is an archaic practice that during the evidence collecting stage, whenever any objection is raised regarding admissibility of any material in evidence the court does not proceed further without passing order on such objection’. And the Court directed as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“When so recast, the practice which can be a better substitute is this: Whenever an objection is raised during evidence taking stage regarding the admissibility of any material or item of oral evidence the trial court can make a note of such objection and mark the objected document tentatively as an exhibit in the case (or record the objected part of the oral evidence) subject to such <span style="text-decoration: underline">objections to be decided at the last stage</span> in the final judgment.”</li>
</ul>
<p>But, the subsequent decisions in RVE Venkatachala Gounder: AIR 2004 SC 4082; Dayamathi Bai (2004) 7  SCC 107 took a contra view. It was held that the objection as to ‘mode of proof’ <span style="text-decoration: underline">should be taken at the time of marking of the document</span> as an exhibit, so that the defect can be cured by the affected party.</p>
<p>Privy Council in Padman v. Hanwanta, AIR 1915 PC 111,held that the objection to marking of documents and its admissibility should have been taken in the trial court. It was observed as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“The defendants have now appeal to the Majesty in Council, and the case has been argued on their behalf in great detail. It was urged in the course of the argument that a registered copy of the will of 1898 was admitted in evidence without sufficient foundation being led for its admission. No objection, however, appears to have been <span style="text-decoration: underline">taken in the first court</span> against the copy obtained from the Registrar’s office being put in evidence. Had such objection being made at the time, the District Judge, who tried the case in the first instance, would <span style="text-decoration: underline">probably have seen that the deficiency was supplied</span>. Their lordships think that there is no substance in the present contention.”</li>
</ul>
<p>In P.C. Purushothama Reddiar v. S Perumal, 1972 (2) SCR 646,it was observed as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“Counsel contended that the police reports referred to earlier are inadmissible in evidence as the Head-constables who covered those meetings have not been examined in the case. Those reports were marked without any objection. Hence it is <span style="text-decoration: underline">not open to the respondent now to object </span>to their admissibility.”</li>
</ul>
<p>Our Apex Court held in Lachhmi Narain Singh v. Sarjug Singh, AIR 2021 SC 3873, as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“24. In view of the foregoing discussion, it is clear that plea regarding mode of proof <span style="text-decoration: underline">cannot be permitted</span> to be taken at the <strong><em>appellate stage for the first time</em></strong>, if not raised before the trial Court at the appropriate stage. This is to avoid prejudice to the party who produced the certified copy of an original document without protest by the other side. If such objection was raised before trial court, then the concerned party <span style="text-decoration: underline">could have cured the mode of proof by summoning the original copy</span> of document. But such opportunity may not be available or possible at a later stage. Therefore, allowing such objection to be raised during the appellate stage would put the party (who placed certified copy on record instead of original copy) in a jeopardy &amp; would seriously prejudice interests of that party. It will also be inconsistent with the rule of fair play as propounded by Justice Ashok Bhan in the case of RVE Venkatachala Gounder v. Arulmigu, AIR 2003 SC 4548.”</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><u>PROBATIVE</u></strong><strong><u> VALUE of a Document</u></strong> <strong><u>is a Matter for the Court</u></strong></p>
<p>Etymology of ‘Probative’ is from ‘Probare’ (Latin), means to prove; and ‘Probatio’ (Latin), means experience, proof, testing, probation etc. In law, ‘probative value’ imparts –</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Sufficiency of evidence to prove something in a trial.</li>
<li>Probability of proof or truth while appreciating a fact.</li>
<li>Value or weight of evidence, considered by the court, in proof of something.</li>
<li>Extent of evidentiary value that can be taken to prove a proffered proposition.</li>
</ul>
<p>Whenever a document is admitted in court, the probative value thereof will be a matter for the court to determine. It is important to note that probative value may ‘include’ truth of contents of documents; but, precisely it is independent from ‘truth’ of contents of documents. </p>
<p><strong><u>Probative Value </u></strong>– <strong><u>Date of Birth in School Register has More Value Than Horoscope</u></strong></p>
<p>If there is a dispute regarding age, the Supreme Court, in State of Punjab v. Mohinder Singh, AIR 2005 SC 1868, held that the date of birth available in the School Admission Register has more probative value than the horoscope. </p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Similarly the probative value of –
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li> FIR, </li>
<li>Scene-Mahazar, </li>
<li>Post-Mortem Report, </li>
<li>Photocopy of a Registered Deed, etc., </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>by itself, will be lesser. In such cases the court can refrain from acting upon such documents until substantive or regular evidence is offered by examining proper witness.</li>
</ul>
<p>In Om Prakash v. State of Punjab, 1993(2) CLR 395, and in Jora Singh v. State of Punjab, 1984(2) Crimes 837, it has been held that an entry in the school leaving certificate regarding date of birth of a student is not a conclusive proof or high ‘<em>probity</em> <em>evidence’ </em>because it is a matter of common knowledge that the date of birth given at the time of the admission of a boy or girl in a school is seldom correct and more often than not the age given is less than the actual age of the child. (See also: C. Doddanarayana Reddy v. C. Jayarama Reddy, AIR 2020 SC 1912; Commissioner of Central Excise And Service Tax v. M/S. Sanjivani Non-Ferrous Trading: AIR 2019 SC 203.)</p>
<p><strong><u>Trial is an inquiry into the Truth</u></strong></p>
<p>In American Jurisprudence, Second Edition, 2007, it is stated as to the purpose of ‘trial’:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“The purpose of trial is to determine the validity of the allegations. The objective is to secure a fair and impartial administration of justice between the parties to the litigation ….Trial is not a contest between lawyers but a presentation of facts to which the law may be applied to resolve the issues between the parties and to determine their rights. It is also not a sport; it is an inquiry into the truth, in which the general public has an interest.” (Quoted in: Mohammed Abdul Wahid v. Nilofer, 2024-2 SCC 144)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">Definition of</span></strong> <strong><u>“Fact” – Evid. Act does  Not Specifically say as to ‘TRUTH’</u></strong></p>
<p>Though ‘Truth’ may fall under ‘Fact’, Evidence Act does not specifically say as to ‘TRUTH’ when dines  ‘Fact’.  Sec. 3 Evidence Act reads as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“Fact” —“Fact” means and includes—</li>
<li>.(1) any thing, state of things, or relation of things, capable of being perceived by the senses;</li>
<li>(2) any mental condition of which any person is conscious. Illustrations
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>.(a) That there are certain objects arranged in a certain order in a certain place, is a fact.</li>
<li>(b) That a man heard or saw something, is a fact.</li>
<li>(c) That a man said certain words, is a fact.</li>
<li>(d) That a man holds a certain opinion, has a certain intention, acts in good faith, or fraudulently, or uses a particular word in a particular sense, or is or was at a specified time conscious of a particular sensation, is a fact.</li>
<li>(e) That a man has a certain reputation, is a fact.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><u>“Proof” – Evid. Act, CPC &amp; CrPC do Not Specifically say as to ‘TRUTH’</u></strong></p>
<p>The express provisions of the procedural laws state only ‘Proof’ as to existence and contents of documents, and not TRUTH.</p>
<p>Sec. 58 of the Evidence Act emphasises that ‘Admitted Facts’ (admitted by opposite side) need not be proved.</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Proviso to Sec. 58 says that the Court can require proof of admitted facts otherwise than by such admissions.</li>
</ul>
<p>Besides Sec. 58 and the powers of the court under Sec. 165 of Evidence Act, the scheme of the Procedural Acts (CPC and CrPC) shows that the court has jurisdiction to require the party concerned to prove admitted (by opposite side) documents. We can see it in – </p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Order VIII Rule 5 CPC</li>
<li>Order XII, Rule 2A(1) Proviso of the CPC and </li>
<li>Sec. 294 of the CrPC .</li>
</ul>
<p>Proviso to Sec. 58 of the Indian Evidence Act provides as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“Provided that the Court may, in its <span style="text-decoration: underline">discretion</span>, require the facts admitted to be proved otherwise than by such admissions.”</li>
</ul>
<p>Order VIII Rule 5 Proviso of the CPC says as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“Provided that the Court may in its <span style="text-decoration: underline">discretion</span> require any fact so admitted to be proved otherwise than by such admission.”</li>
</ul>
<p>Order XII, Rule 2A(1) Proviso of the CPC says as under: </p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Provided that the Court may, in its <span style="text-decoration: underline">discretion</span> and for reasons to be recorded, require any document so admitted to be proved otherwise than by such admission.</li>
</ul>
<p>Proviso to Sec. 294(3) of Code of Criminal Procedure reads as follows:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“Provided that the Court may, in its <span style="text-decoration: underline">discretion</span>, require such signature to be proved.”</li>
</ul>
<p>Therefore, it is clear –</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Admitted documents stand ‘proved’, according to procedural laws. Its existence and contents cannot be challenged by the party which admit it.</li>
<li>But, the Court can, in its <span style="text-decoration: underline">discretion</span>, require proof of these admitted facts (existence and contents) “otherwise than by such admissions”.</li>
<li>The procedural laws contemplate here – ‘Proof’ (existence and contents) and not TRUTH.  </li>
</ul>
<p><strong><u>Proof must be by one who can Vouchsafe for Truth</u></strong> –<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline"> Not Correct in All Cases</span></strong></p>
<p>In <em>Narbada Devi Gupta v. Birendra Kumar Jaiswal, 2003-8 SCC 745, it is held:</em></p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“Reliance is heavily placed on behalf of the appellant on Ramji Dayawala v. Invest Import: AIR 1981 SC 2085.<a href="https://www.scconline.com/blog/post/2020/04/29/practice-and-procedure-relating-to-proof-of-documents/#_ftn25"> </a>The legal position is not in dispute that <span style="text-decoration: underline">mere production and marking</span> of a document as exhibit by the court cannot be held to be a due proof of its contents. Its execution has to be proved by admissible evidence, that is, by the <span style="text-decoration: underline">evidence of those persons who can vouchsafe for the truth of the facts in issue</span>”.</li>
</ul>
<p>But, it may <span style="text-decoration: underline">not</span> be correct in all cases; because, there may be cases where proof (as to ‘existence and contents’ of a document) can be given by a witnesses who cannot vouchsafe truth – e.g., a letter or a deed obtained by a witness in ‘due/common course’.  In such cases, when ‘truth’ as to the contents of a document is in dispute, it has to be proved by a competent person.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">Time for Consideration of ‘Truth</span><span style="text-decoration: underline">‘ by the Court</span></strong></p>
<p>In any case, the truth of the contents of a document is <span style="text-decoration: underline">not</span> considered by the court at the time of marking a document; and, it comes for consideration at the fag end, while considering entire evidence on the matter including the cross examination of the witness through whom the document is marked.</p>

<li>Shanmugam v. Ariya Kshatriya, (2012) 6 SCC 430.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline"><mark class="has-inline-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#f006f6">Now a question comes – Which provision of the Indian Evidence Act deals with ‘deducing or deriving’ TRUTH ?</mark></span></strong></p>
<p>In such an inquisition, we legitimately arrive at in-</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>(i)  the definition of “Proved” in Sec. 3, and</li>
<li>(ii) “Presumption” in Sec. 114, Evidence Act.</li>
</ul>
<p>The definition of  “Proved” in Sec. 3 gives vast discretion to the court. It reads as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>” ‘<span style="text-decoration: underline">Proved</span>‘ — A fact is said to be proved when, after considering the matters before it, the Court; either BELIEVES it to exist, or CONSIDERS its existence so PROBABLE that a prudent man ought, under the circumstances of the particular case, to act upon the supposition that it exists.”</li>
</ul>
<p>To fulfill the prime and onerous duty on the court,  that is <span style="text-decoration: underline">deducing or deriving TRUTH</span> from the disputed matters, the Evidence Act further enables and authorises the court to invoke <u>PRESUMPTION</u> under Sec. 114 Evidence Act, wherever it is required.</p>
<p>Sec. 114 reads as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“114. <span style="text-decoration: underline">Court may presume existence of certain facts</span> —The Court may PRESUME the existence of <strong><u>any fact</u></strong> which it thinks likely to have happened, regard being had to the common course of natural events, human conduct and public and private business, in their relation to the facts of the particular case.”</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline">Presumption of <u>Truth</u> is taken ‘on something Proved</span>‘, <span style="text-decoration: underline"><span style="text-decoration: underline">or taken for granted</span></span></p>
<p>In Izhar Ahmad Khan v. Union of India, AIR 1962 SC 1052, the Supreme Court definitely observed that presumption of <u>truth</u> is taken ‘on something <span style="text-decoration: underline">proved or taken for granted</span> ‘. It reads as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“The term ‘<span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>presumption</strong></span>’ in its largest and most comprehensive signification, <span style="text-decoration: underline">may be defined to mean inference</span>, affirmative or dis-affirmative <span style="text-decoration: underline">of the </span><strong><u>truth</u></strong> or falsehood of a doubtful fact or proposition drawn by a process of probable reasoning <span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>from something proved</strong> or taken for granted</span>.”</li>
</ul>
<p>The Apex Court further quoted James Bradley Tayer (American jurist and author of Treatise on Evidence) which reads as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“Presumptions are aids to reasoning argumentation, which <span style="text-decoration: underline">assume the <strong><u>truth </u></strong>of certain matters</span> for the purpose of some given inquiry. …”.</li>
</ul>
<p>In State of West Bengal v. Mir Mohammad Omar, 2000-8 SCC 382, it is observed as under: </p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“33. <span style="text-decoration: underline">Presumption of fact is an inference as to the existence of one fact from the existence of some other facts</span>, <span style="text-decoration: underline">unless the <strong>truth</strong> </span>of such inference is <span style="text-decoration: underline">disproved</span>. Presumption of fact is a rule in law of evidence that a fact otherwise doubtful may be inferred from certain other proved facts. When inferring the existence of a fact from other set of proved facts, the court exercises a process of reasoning and reach a logical conclusion as the most probable position. The above principle has gained legislative recognition in India when Sec. 114 is incorporated in the Evidence Act. It empowers the court to presume the existence of any fact which it thinks likely to have happened. In that process court shall have regard to the common course of natural events, human conduct etc. in relation to the facts of the case.”</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec. 90, Evid. Aact – Not Truth of Contents; But, Genuineness Drawn</span></strong></p>
<p>Under Sec. 90, Not Truth of Contents, but, only presumption of Genuineness of a document (i.e., existence or handwriting), is drawn (<mark class="has-inline-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#6b0ac5"><strong>Union of India v. Ibrahim Uddin: (2012) 8 SCC 148</strong></mark>). Therefore, besides TRUTH, the contents of the documents also have to be proved by cogent evidence.</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>No doubt, under Sec. 114, TRUTH can be presumed, directly, in proper cases, in their peculiar ensuring facts (regard being had to the common course of natural events, human conduct and public and private business, in their relation to the facts of the particular case).</li>
<li>That is, if the document is a public document an “added presumption” (as to correctness) under Section 114(e) is available -KalitaIqbal Basith and others v. N Subbalakshmi, (2021) 2 SCC 718.</li>
</ul>
<p>Sec. 90 CPC, basically, speaks about two things – as regards 30-year-documents:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>1. A document purports to be in the handwriting of any particular person is presumed to be in his handwriting.</li>
<li>2. A document purports to be executed or attested is presumed to be duly executed and attested.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><u><mark class="has-inline-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#cc06cc">Our Courts Act Upon ‘LEGAL TRUTH’; and not ‘ULTIMATE TRUTH’</mark></u></strong></p>
<p>As shown above, the very duty of a court is to find TRUTH. Our courts are said to be functioning in ‘adversarial system’ where advocates present the case of their parties before an impartial judge for determining the truth and for getting a judgment accordingly. In such a system, the courts are concerned with ‘PROCEDURAL TRUTH’ or <strong>‘LEGAL TRUTH’</strong> as emerged from the pleadings and evidence; and not ULTIMATE TRUTH. </p>
<p>In State of Rajasthan v. Asharam @ Ashumal, AIR  2023 SC 2228, it is observed as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“In a well-designed system, judicial findings of formal <span style="text-decoration: underline"><mark class="has-inline-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#0c07e3"><strong>legal truth</strong> should coincide with <strong>substantive truth</strong></mark></span>.” (Also see: Kailash Vijayvargiya v. Rajlakshmi Chaudhuri, 2023-6 JT 138.)</li>
</ul>
<p>Viscount Simon LC, explained it in Hickman v.  Peacey, [1945] AC 304, as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“A court of law … is <span style="text-decoration: underline">not engaged in ascertaining ultimate verities</span>: it is engaged in determining what is the proper result to be arrived at, <span style="text-decoration: underline">having regard to the evidence before it</span>.”</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">Conjectures and Suspicion Should Not take the place of</span> <u>Legal Truth</u></strong>.</p>
<p>In Ritesh Chakarvarti v. State of Madhya Pradesh, 2007-1 SCC(Cr) 744, our Apex Court warned as under: </p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“There is another aspect of the matter, which <span style="text-decoration: underline">cannot be lost sight of</span>. While dealing with a case of grave nature like the present one, there is always a danger that <span style="text-decoration: underline">conjectures and suspicion may take the place of</span> <strong><u>legal truth</u></strong>.” (See also: Aloke Nath Dutta v. State of West Bengal, 2007-12 SCC 230.) </li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">Subjective Satisfaction and Objective Consideration by the Court</span></strong></p>
<p>It is evident from Sec. 3 of the Indian Evidence Act that TRUTH (or otherwise) of a disputed matter is left to the <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">Subjective Satisfaction</span></strong> of the court. The definition of ‘proved’ in Sec. 3 of the Evidence Act says that ‘a fact is said to be proved when (after considering the matter before it) the court either <strong>believes</strong> it to exist, or <strong>considers</strong> its existence so <strong>probable</strong> that a <span style="text-decoration: underline">prudent man</span> ought, under the circumstances of the particular case, to act upon the supposition that it exists’.  Further, S.114 of the Evidence Act allows the court to <strong>presume</strong> the existence of any fact which it <strong>thinks</strong> likely to have happened regard being had to the common course of natural events, human conduct, etc.</p>
<p>The Evidence Act itself lays down the <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">objective</span></strong> methods, including adequate restrictions, to arrive at the subjective satisfaction to determine the truth. The definition of ‘proved’ itself provides for ‘<span style="text-decoration: underline">consideration of the matters before it</span>’. The provision in Sec. 27 which bars the use of statement, given to police while an accused is in custody, is an important restriction in that line.  </p>
<p>In Karunakaran v. State, (1960) 2 Ker LR 247, it is observed as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“The practice of attestation of confessional statement by witnesses is an objectionable one. It prejudices the accused to safeguard whose interest the Legislature has enacted Ss. 24 fo 26 of the Evidence Act. It has no legal sanction behind it. There is no harm in recording the accused’s statement in the first person at any great length in the case diary when the accused is arrested and questioned and in the preamble to the recovery mahazar reference to the reasons leading to the recovery may be made.</li>
<li>The whole thing appears to be an “intentional whittling down” of the wholesome provisions of Ss. 25 and 26 of the Evidence Act. It is very easily said that the incriminating portion of a lengthy confessional “statement should be excluded. But it is a <span style="text-decoration: underline">very difficult mental process to close your eyes to the details in the confessional statement and see only the bracketed portion</span> and remain uninfluenced by the confession of the accused. This feat is possible of performance only by a few specially trained experts. There is no reason why the overburdened judicial officers should be saddled with an additional burden which has not the support of law or procedure.” (Quoted in: Mohammed v. State of Kerala, 1963 Cri LJ 175; Thadiyanevida Nazeer @ Ummer Haji v. State of Kerala (2022) and K Babu v. State of Kerala, 2023(6) KLT 96)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><u><strong><u>Our Courts</u></strong> Apply Different ‘STANDADARDS of Proof’</u></strong></p>
<p>In the process to take a fact ‘proved’, ‘disproved’, or ‘not proved’ the courts have to weigh probabilities. In Bater v Bater,  (1950) 2 All ER 458, Lord Denning pointed out –  ‘there is no absolute standard’, and higher degree of proof is required for more serious matters like criminal cases. Therefore, the courts apply different ‘STANDADARDS of Proof’ in  different cases and the courts use distinctive scales in the judicial process of pondering on probabilities. </p>

<p><strong><u>Mechanical Interpretation with Dictionary and Grammar Inadequate</u></strong></p>
<p>MH Beg, J. (as he then was) in Rishi Kesh Singh v. The State, AIR 1970 All. 51, pointed out as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“100.

</ul>
<p><strong><u>Facts of Common Knowledge and Internal Evidence</u></strong></p>
<p>The following things can also be invoked for placing ‘truth’ of contents of documents –  </p>
<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li>The <span style="text-decoration: underline">matters of common knowledge</span> (It does not require proof. See: Union of India v. Virendra Bharti: 2011-2 ACC 886, 2010  ACJ 2353; Rakhal Chakraborty v. Sanjib Kumar Roy: 1998-1 GauLR 253, 1997-2 GauLT 705) and</li>

</ol>
<p><strong><u>Admissibility of a Document is One Thing and its Probative (Proof) Value Quite Another</u></strong></p>
<p>Admittance of documents in evidence, and its proof are two different matters. In Baldeo Sahai v. Ram Chander, AIR 1931 Lahore 546, it is held as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“There are two stages relating to documents. One is the stage when all the documents on which the parties rely are filed by them in Court. The next stage is when the documents proved and formally tendered in evidence. The word “proved” has been used by the Division Bench in the sense of ‘proposed to be proved’ as is clear from its having been used along with the word ‘tendered’ or “admitted” in evidence. The word proved has been loosely used for describing the stage after fling of the documents, when the Court would decide only whether they should be admitted or rejected. The Division Bench cannot be read as holding that the document is not to be endorsed with an Exhibit number unless and until proved. As stated hereinabove, the <span style="text-decoration: underline">stages of tendering/admitting/rejecting in evidence and holding a document proved – are two distinct and different stages</span>, not one. They are respectively the second and third stages. <span style="text-decoration: underline">Admission of a document in evidence is not to be confused with proof of a document.</span>”</li>

The dying declaration was recorded by the Doctor.  The original dying declaration had not been filed by the prosecution and the carbon copy was produced. The Doctor deposed that even after conducting an extensive search, the original dying declaration could not have been traced. Pointing out that the secondary evidence can be adduced in any form, provided it is authenticated by foundational evidence that the alleged copy is in fact a true copy of the original, the Apex Court held as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“Section 65(c) of the Act 1872 provides that secondary evidence can be adduced relating to a document when the original has been destroyed or lost, or when the party offering evidence of its contents cannot, for any other reason, not arising from his own default, or neglect, produce it in reasonable time. The <span style="text-decoration: underline">court is obliged to examine the <strong>probative value</strong></span> of documents produced in court or their contents <span style="text-decoration: underline">and decide the question of admissibility of a document in secondary evidence</span>.

<p>E.g. – A per se ‘objectionable document’ marked without objection; un-cross-examined testimony of a witness; Photocopy of a deed certified copy of which is provided in law.</p>
<p>In Life Insurance Corporation of India v. Rampal Singh Bisen, (2010) 4 SCC 491, it is held as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“26. We are of the firm opinion that mere admission of document in evidence does not amount to its proof. In other words, <strong><u>mere marking</u></strong> of exhibit on a document <strong><u>does not dispense with its proof</u></strong>, which is required to be done in accordance with law. As has been mentioned herein above, despite perusal of the record, we have not been able to come to know as to under what circumstances respondent plaintiff had admitted those documents. Even otherwise, his admission of those documents cannot carry the case of the appellants any further and much to the prejudice of the respondent.</li>
<li>27. It was the duty of the appellants to have proved documents Exh. A-1 to Exh. A-10 in accordance with law. <span style="text-decoration: underline">Filing of the Inquiry Report</span> or the evidence adduced during the domestic enquiry <span style="text-decoration: underline">would not partake the character of admissible evidence</span> in a court of law. That documentary evidence was also required to be proved by the appellants in accordance with the provisions of the Evidence Act, which they have failed to do.”</li>
<li>“31. Under the Law of Evidence also, it is necessary that contents of documents are required to be proved either by primary or by secondary evidence. At the most,<strong> <span style="text-decoration: underline">admission of documents may amount to admission of contents but not its truth</span></strong>. Documents having not been produced and marked as required under the Evidence Act cannot be relied upon by the Court. Contents of the document cannot be proved by merely filing in a court.”</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><u>Marking <strong><u>Document  Without Objection</u></strong></u></strong> <strong><u>– Not Dispense with Proof of Contents</u></strong> </p>
<p>When a document is marked without objection –</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline">the affected party is <strong>precluded from raising objection to the existence</strong></span> of the document and its contents. </li>
<li>Still, he can point out – <span style="text-decoration: underline">mere admission of a document in evidence does not amount to its proof</span>; and the <span style="text-decoration: underline">probative value of it is low or ni</span>l, for want of proper proof.</li>
</ul>
<p>In Sait Tarajee Khimchand v. Yelamarti Satyam, AIR 1971 SC 1865, the Supreme Court observed that <span style="text-decoration: underline">mere marking of documents</span> (day book and ledger) as exhibits do <span style="text-decoration: underline">not dispense with the proof</span> of documents. In Nandkishore Lalbhai Mehta v. New Era Fabrics, AIR 2015 SC 3796, it is observed that mere marking as exhibit and identification of executor’s signature by one of witnesses do not prove contents of a document.</p>
<p>In Smt. Dayamathi Bai v. KM Shaffi, AIR 2004 SC 4082, it is observed as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“In the present case the objection was not that the certified copy of Ex.P1 is in itself inadmissible but that the mode of proof was irregular and insufficient. <span style="text-decoration: underline">Objection as to the mode of proof falls within procedural law</span>. Therefore, <span style="text-decoration: underline">such objections could be waived</span>. They have to be taken before the document is marked as an exhibit and admitted to the record (See: Order XIII Rule 3 of Code of Civil Procedure). This aspect has been brought out succinctly in the judgment of this Court in RVE Venkatachala Gounder v. Arulmigu Viswesaraswami &amp; VP Temple &amp; Another reported in [(2003) 8 SCC 752] to which one of us, Bhan, J., was a party vide para 20:</li>
<li>“20. The learned counsel for the defendant-respondent has relied on Roman Catholic Mission v. State of Madras [AIR 1966 SC 1457] in support of his submission that a <span style="text-decoration: underline">document not admissible in evidence,</span> though brought on record, <span style="text-decoration: underline">has to be excluded from consideration</span>. We do not have any dispute with the proposition of law so laid down in the abovesaid case. However, the present one is a case which calls for the correct position of law being made precise. <span style="text-decoration: underline">Ordinarily, an objection to the admissibility</span> of evidence should be taken <span style="text-decoration: underline">when it is tendered</span> and not subsequently. The objections as to admissibility of documents in evidence may be classified into two classes: 
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>(i) an objection that the document which is sought to be proved is itself <span style="text-decoration: underline">inadmissible in evidence</span>; and </li>
<li>(ii) where the objection does not dispute the admissibility of the document in evidence but is directed towards the <span style="text-decoration: underline">mode of proof</span> alleging the same to be irregular or insufficient. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline">In the first case</span>, merely because a document has been marked as “an exhibit”, <span style="text-decoration: underline">an objection </span>as to its admissibility is not excluded and is <span style="text-decoration: underline">available to be raised even at a later stage</span> or even in appeal or revision. </li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline">In the latter case, the objection should be taken when the evidence is tendered </span>and once the document has been admitted in evidence and marked as an exhibit, the objection that it should not have been admitted in evidence or that the mode adopted for proving the document is irregular cannot be allowed to be raised at any stage subsequent to the marking of the document as an exhibit. </li>
<li>The latter proposition is a rule of fair play. The crucial test is whether an <span style="text-decoration: underline">objection, if taken at the appropriate point of time, would have enabled the party tendering the evidence to cure the defect</span> and resort to such mode of proof as would be regular. The omission to object becomes fatal because by his failure the party entitled to object allows the party tendering the evidence to act on an assumption that the opposite party is not serious about the mode of proof. On the other hand, <span style="text-decoration: underline">a prompt objection</span> does not prejudice the party tendering the evidence, for two reasons: firstly, it enables the court to apply its mind and pronounce its decision on the question of admissibility then and there; and secondly, in the event of f<span style="text-decoration: underline">inding of the court on the mode of proof</span> sought to be adopted going against the party tendering the evidence, the <span style="text-decoration: underline">opportunity</span> of seeking indulgence of the court <span style="text-decoration: underline">for permitting a regular mode</span> or method of proof and thereby removing the objection raised by the opposite party, is available to the party leading the evidence. Such practice and procedure is fair to both the parties. </li>
<li>Out of the two types of objections, referred to hereinabove, in the latter case, failure to raise a prompt and timely objection amounts to waiver of the necessity for insisting on formal proof of a document, the document itself which is sought to be proved being admissible in evidence. <span style="text-decoration: underline">In the first case, acquiescence would be no bar</span> to raising the objection in a superior court.”</li>
</ul>
<p>In Kaliya v. State of Madhya Pradesh, 2013-10 SCC 758, it is held as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“However, the secondary evidence of an ordinary document is admissible only and only when the party desirous of admitting it has proved before the court that it was not in his possession or control of it and further, that he has done what could be done to procure the production of it. Thus, the party has to account for the non-production in one of the ways indicated in the section. The party further has to lay down the factual foundation to establish the right to give secondary evidence where the original document cannot be produced. When the party gives in evidence a certified copy/secondary evidence without proving the circumstances entitling him to give secondary evidence, the opposite party must<span style="text-decoration: underline"> raise an objection at the time of admission</span>. In case, an objection is not raised at that point of time, it is <span style="text-decoration: underline">precluded from being raised at a belated stage</span>.</li>
<li>Further, mere admission of a document in evidence does not amount to its proof. Nor, <span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>mere marking of exhibit</strong> on a document does <strong>not dispense with its proof</strong>,</span> which is otherwise required to be done in accordance with law.

<p><strong><u><strong>TRUTH has to be Established</strong></u></strong>, <strong><u><strong>Despite Waiver of Formal Proof </strong></u></strong></p>
<p>In Dibakar Behera v. Padmabati Behera, AIR 2008 Ori 92, it is observed as under [referring various judgments including RVE Venkatachala Gounder v. Arulmigu Viswesaraswami, AIR 2003  SC  4548, Dayamati Bai v. K.M. Shaffi, 2004 SC 4082, Bhagyarathi Das v. Agadhu Charan Das, 62 (1986) CLT 298,  Budhi Mahal v. Gangadhar Das, 46 (1978) CLT 287]:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“A close reading of the above noted judicial pronouncements would show that whenever a document is marked as exhibit without objection, it will be presumed that a party having right of objection has waived formal proof of the document and in such situation, the entire contents of the document would be admissible in evidence. <span style="text-decoration: underline">However, by such admission of document, the <strong>truth</strong> and <strong>correctnes</strong>s of the contents by itself would not be established </span>and there must be some evidence to support the contents of such document.”</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><u>IF ‘TRUTH’ IS IN ISSUE – Mere Marking Not Amounts to ‘Waiver’</u></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>IF the TRUTH is IN ISSUE</em></strong><strong> mere proof of handwriting</strong> <strong>or execution not evidence of truth</strong>:   <em>IF the TRUTH of the facts stated in a document is IN ISSUE</em> mere proof of the hand-writing and execution of the document would not furnish evidence of the truth of the facts or contents of the document.</p>
<p>In <strong>Ramji Dayawala v. Invest Import</strong>: AIR 1981 SC 2085, it us held as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“<span style="text-decoration: underline">If the truth of the facts stated in a document is in issue</span> mere proof of the handwriting and execution of the document would not furnish evidence of the truth of the facts or contents of the document. The truth or otherwise of the facts or contents so stated would have to be proved by admissible evidence, i.e. by the evidence of those <span style="text-decoration: underline">persons who can vouchsafe</span> for the truth of the facts in issue.”</li>
</ul>
<p>If ‘truth’ is in issue, or in dispute, <em>marking without objection </em>by itself does not absolve the duty to prove the truth as to the contents of the documents. (See: Achuthan Pillai v. Marikar (Motors) Ltd., AIR 1983 Ker 81, 1976 Cr.LJ 1507; 2016 (1) Gau. LJ 88,  2012(1) CTC 53; 2013-1 KLT 293.)</p>
<p><strong><u>Secondary</u></strong><strong><u> Evidence Relating to the Contents of a Document</u></strong></p>
<p>Secondary evidence relating to the contents of a document is inadmissible, until the non-production of the original is accounted for. The secondary evidence must be authenticated by foundational evidence that the alleged copy is in fact a true copy of the original. Mere admission of a document in evidence does not amount to its proof. Therefore, the documentary evidence is required to be proved in accordance with law.</p>
<p>The court has an obligation to decide the question of admissibility of a document in secondary evidence before making endorsement thereon. [H. Siddiqui v. A. Ramalingam: AIR 2011 SC 1492; Nandkishore Lalbhai Mehta v. New Era Fabrics: AIR  2015  SC 3796]</p>
<p>In Rakesh Mohindra v. Anita Beri, 2015 AIR(SCW) 6271,  it is held:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“<span style="text-decoration: underline">Mere admission of secondary evidence</span>, does <span style="text-decoration: underline">not amount to its proof</span>. The genuineness, correctness and existence of the document shall have to be established during the trial and the trial <span style="text-decoration: underline">court shall record the reasons</span> before relying on those secondary evidences.”</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><u>Court Examines Probative Value of Secondary Evidence</u></strong></p>
<p>It is well settled that if a party wishes to lead secondary evidence, the Court is obliged to examine the probative value of the document produced in the Court or their contents and decide the question of admissibility of a document in secondary evidence [Rakesh Mohindra v. Anita Beri: 2015  AIR(SCW) 6271].</p>
<p><strong><u>Admission</u></strong><strong> <u>may Dispense with Proof</u>; <u>but <em>Probative Value</em> May Be Less or Nil</u></strong></p>
<p>Contents of the document cannot be proved by mere filing the document in a court. Under the Law of Evidence, it is necessary that contents of documents are required to be proved either by primary or by secondary evidence. Mere marking a document as an ‘exhibit’ will not absolve the duty of to prove the documents in accordance with the provisions of the Evidence Act. At the most, marking ‘exhibit’may amount to proof of contents, but not its truth.</p>
<p>Documents which are not produced and marked as required under the Evidence Act cannot be relied upon by the Court. </p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>See: LIC v. Ram Pal Singh Bisen, 2010-4 SCC 491 (Filing of the Inquiry Report or the evidence adduced during the domestic enquiry);</li>
<li>M. Chandra v. M. Thangamuthu. Nandkishore Lalbhai Mehta Vs.New Era Fabrics, AIR 2015 SC 3796;</li>
<li>Birad Mal Singhvi v. Anand Purohitb, 1988 (Supp) SCC 604 (date of birth).</li>
</ul>
<p>Even when a document is technically admitted in court, the probative value thereof will always be a matter for the court to determine. That is, it is depended upon the nature of each case. The probative value of Scene-Mahazar, Postmortem Report, photocopy of a Registered Deed etc. without supporting legal evidence may be lesser. In such cases the court can refrain from acting upon such documents until regular evidence is tendered.</p>
<p>In <em>Life Insurance Corporation of India v. Ram Pal Singh Bisen, </em>2010-4 SCC 491<em>, it is </em>observed as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“26. We are of the firm opinion that <span style="text-decoration: underline">mere admission of document</span> in evidence <span style="text-decoration: underline">does amount to its proof.</span> In other words, mere marking of exhibit on a document does dispense with its proof, which is required to be done in accordance with law. …..</li>

That documentary evidence was also required to be proved by the appellants in accordance with the provisions of the Evidence Act, which they have failed to do.”</li>
</ul>
<p>The Calcutta High Court (DB) quoting Life Insurance Corporation of India v. Ram Pal Singh Bisen [2010-4 SCC 491] it is observed in Bajaj Allianz General Insurance Company v. Smt. Santa Dey (2019-2 ACC 36: 2018-3 TAC 473) as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“On the authority of the aforesaid decision, we hold that even if the document had been <span style="text-decoration: underline">marked</span> as Exhibit-A <span style="text-decoration: underline">without objection, without a formal proof</span> thereof in accordance with the provisions of the Evidence Act, such  document lost its credibility and is of <span style="text-decoration: underline">no probative value</span>.”</li>
</ul>
<p>In Kalyan Singh v. Chhoti, AIR 1990 SC 396, it is observed as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><em>“</em>A certified copy of a registered sale deed may be produced as secondary evidence in the absence of the original. But in the present case Ex. 3 is <span style="text-decoration: underline">not certified copy. It is just an ordinary copy</span>. There is also <span style="text-decoration: underline">no evidence regarding content</span> of the original sale deed. Ex.3 <span style="text-decoration: underline">cannot therefore, be considered as secondary evidence</span>. The appellate Court has a right and duty to exclude such evidence.”</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><u>Should the Court <em>Allow</em> to Adduce Proper Evidence to Prove Documents</u></strong></p>
<p>As stated in detail above, besides the powers of the court under Sec. 165 of Evidence Act, the scheme of the Procedural Acts (Sec. 58 of Evidence Act and Order XII, Rule 2A Proviso of the CPC and Sec. 294 of the CrPC) show that the courts have jurisdiction to require the parties concerned to prove documents that are marked on admission <em>(by the opposite side) </em>–</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>without proper proof (of contents of the document or its truth), and</li>
<li>without ‘foundational evidence’ for a secondary evidence. </li>
</ul>
<p>In such a case, it is legitimate to say that the court should, before taking an adverse stance as to proof in this count, give an opportunity to cure the deficiency by the party who relies on such document.</p>
<p><strong><u>PROOF INVOKING PRESUMPTION</u></strong><strong><u> – Sec. 114, read with Sec. 35, Evid. Act</u></strong></p>
<p>The evidence/proof of contents of document may be given by proving circumstances for the same or by invoking presumption also. ‘Common course of natural events’, ‘human conduct’ etc. under S. 114, Evd. Act can be used to prove the existence and genuineness/ truth of a document.</p>
<p>Sec. 35 of the Evidence Act reads as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“35. <span style="text-decoration: underline">Relevancy of entry in public record or an electronic record made in performance of duty</span>: An entry in any public or other official book, register or record or an electronic record, stating a fact in issue or relevant fact, and made by a public servant in the discharge of his official duty, or by any other person in performance of a duty specially enjoined by the law of the country in which such book, register, or record or an electronic record is kept, is itself a relevant fact.</li>
</ul>
<p>Under S. 114, Illustration (e) for Judicial and official acts there is presumption as to ‘regularity’.  It is not presumption as to correctness or truth. For such presumption, one can resort to main section, Sec. 114 – that is, ‘common course of natural events’, ‘human conduct’ etc. (and not ‘regularity’ in Illus.–e).</p>
<p><strong><u>Presumption and Truth</u></strong></p>
<p>As shown above, in Izhar Ahmad Khan v. Union of India, AIR 1962 SC 1052, it was observed that the term ‘presumption’ includes, in its largest and most comprehensive signification, inference of the <strong><u>truth</u></strong> or falsehood of a doubtful fact. And in St. of West Bengal v. Mir Mohammad Omar, AIR 2000 SC 2988, it is held  that the <span style="text-decoration: underline">Presumption of fact is an inference</span> as to the existence of one fact from the existence of some other facts, <span style="text-decoration: underline">unless the <strong>truth</strong> of such inference is disproved</span>. </p>
<p>In Dalchand Mulchand v. Hasanbi, AIR 1938 Nag 152 (Vivian Bose and Puranik JJ.), held as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“The initial burden of proving execution of a document when it is denied is upon the person alleging execution. But if nothing else is known the mere fact that a document is admitted to bear a certain signature and that it comes from proper custody ought to be enough to raise an inference that it was signed with the intention of execution. This inference arises in India directly from Sec. 114, Evidence Act. <span style="text-decoration: underline">Persons do not ordinarily sign documents without intending to execute them</span>: that is not the common course of human conduct, nor yet the common course their public or private business. <span style="text-decoration: underline">Consequently if any person wants to rely on an exceptional circumstance</span>, if he wants to show that in some particular instance the ordinary rule was abrogated surely <span style="text-decoration: underline">he must prove it</span> and thus the burden shifts on him”.</li>
</ul>
<p>Referring relevant provisions of Himachal Land Revenue Act, 1954 and Sec. 35 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872, it is held in Partap Singh v. Shiv Ram: AIR 2020 SC 1382, that <span style="text-decoration: underline">Record-of-rights (Revenue document) carries the ‘presumption of <strong>correctness</strong></span>‘.</p>
<p>In Inder Singh v. S. Raghbir Singh, AIR 1978 P&amp;H 98, it is observed as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“The principle is that an <span style="text-decoration: underline">official record</span>, kept by a person, upon whom there is a public duty to make entries in it <span style="text-decoration: underline">only after satisfying himself of the truth of those entries</span>, is presumed to be correct. <span style="text-decoration: underline">Such a document itself is evidence of the <strong>truth</strong> of its contents</span> unless and until its falsity can be demonstrated by any of the various methods by which the evidentiary value of any public book, register or document may be attacked.”</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><u>Conclusion</u></strong></p>
<p>From the above, the accepted position of law, as regards the PROOF and TRUTH of documents, can be summarised as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>1.</strong> <span style="text-decoration: underline">Probative value</span> of a document will be a matter for the court to determine on the basis of legal reasoning.</li>
<li><strong>2.</strong> Though a document is relevant and marked without objection, or marked on admission, the <span style="text-decoration: underline">probative value</span> of it may be low or nil, for want of proper PROOF.</li>
<li><strong>3.</strong> Admittance and Marking of a document may amount to admission of its contents, but not necessarily its TRUTH.</li>
<li><strong>4.</strong> The Evidence Act and other procedural laws do not expressly say as to TRUTH of contents of Documents. It is left to the ‘judicial discretion’ of the Court to be ‘deduced or derived’ by legal reasoning.</li>
<li><strong>5.</strong> <mark class="has-inline-color has-foreground-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">The scheme of the Evidence Act is to presume TRUTH of contents of documents (in proper cases) when ‘existence and contents’ of the same are proved.</mark></li>
<li><strong>6.</strong> For ‘deducing or deriving’ TRUTH of contents of Documents, the party concerned can place for consideration of the court –  (i) oral evidence of one who can vouchsafe the same, (ii) express admission by the other side and (iii) circumstantial evidence or ‘presumptions’ available in the matter.</li>
</ul>
<p>It can be seen that the ‘discretion’ conferred on the courts as regards TRUTH of contents of documents is founded in Indian Law following, the English Legal Principles which allows high degree of discretion to the trial courts to determine whether a document stands proved or not and it is honoured by the appellate courts.</p>
