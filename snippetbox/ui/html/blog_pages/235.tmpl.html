<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">Unstamped document cannot be looked at even for any collateral purpose</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration:underline">Privy Council</span> in Ram Rattan v. Parma Nath,<strong> </strong>AIR 1946 PC 51, held that section 35 of the Stamp Act <span style="text-decoration:underline">prohibited the unstamped (or inadequately stamped) document from being looked at even for any collateral purpose</span>, as it enacts that no instrument chargeable with duty shall be admitted in evidence ‘for any purpose’. The unstamped (or inadequately stamped) document <span style="text-decoration:underline">becomes admissible on payment of penalty</span> under Stamp Act or on payment of the stamp duty after impounding.</p>
<p>In <strong>Omprakash v. Laxminarayan</strong>, (2014) 1 SCC 618, the Apex Court observed as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li class="has-small-font-size">“From a <span style="text-decoration:underline">plain reading of the aforesaid provision (S. 35 of the Stamp Act),</span> it is evident that an authority to receive evidence <span style="text-decoration:underline">shall not admit any instrument unless it is duly stamped. </span>An instrument not duly stamped shall be admitted in evidence on payment of the duty with which the same is chargeable or in the case of an instrument insufficiently stamped, of the amount required to make up such duty together with penalty. As we have observed earlier, the deed of agreement having been insufficiently stamped, the same was inadmissible in evidence. The court being an authority to receive a document in evidence to give effect thereto, the agreement to sell with possession is an instrument which requires payment of the stamp duty applicable to a deed of conveyance. Duty as required, has not been paid and, hence, the <span style="text-decoration:underline">trial court rightly held the same to be inadmissible in evidence</span>.” </li>
</ul>
<p>The Apex Court upheld, in <strong>Omprakash v. Laxminarayan</strong>, the observation of the MP High Court in Writ Petition No. 6464 of 2008, overruling the impugned judgment (Laxminarayan v. Omprakash 2008 (2) MPLJ 416). The MP High Court had observed as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li class="has-small-font-size">“To put the record straight, the correctness of the<span style="text-decoration: underline"> impugned judgment (Laxminarayan &amp; Ors. v. Omprakash &amp; Ors., 2008 (2) MPLJ 416</span>) came up for consideration before a Division Bench of the High Court itself in <span style="text-decoration:underline">Writ Petition No. 6464 of 2008</span> (Man Singh (deceased) through Legal Representatives Smt. Sumranbai &amp; Ors. v. Rameshwar) and same has been overruled by judgment dated January 22, 2010. The High Court observed as follows:
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“8. A document would be admissible on basis of the recitals made in the document and not on basis of the pleadings raised by the parties. In the matter of Laxminarayan (supra), the learned Single Judge with due respect to his authority we don’t think that he did look into the legal position but it appears that he was simply swayed away by the argument that as the defendant was denying the delivery of possession, the endorsement/recital in the document lost all its effect and efficacy.</li>
<li>9. It would be trite to say that if in a document certain recitals are made then the Court would decide the admissibility of the document on the strength of such recitals and not otherwise. In a given case, if there is an absolute unregistered sale deed and the parties say that the same is not required to be registered then we don’t think that the Court would be entitled to admit the document because simply the parties say so. The <span style="text-decoration: underline">jurisdiction of the Court flows from Sections <strong>33, 35</strong> and<strong> 38 of the Indian Stamp Act </strong>and the </span><span style="text-decoration:underline">Court has to decide the question of admissibility</span>. With all humility at our command we over-rule the judgment in the matter of Laxminarayan (supra).” </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="has-small-font-size">We respectfully agree with the conclusion of the High Court (<span style="text-decoration:underline">Writ Petition No. 6464 of 2008</span>)  in this regard.</li>
<li class="has-small-font-size">In view of what we have observed above, the order of the High Court (Laxminarayan v. Omprakash 2008 (2) MPLJ 416) is unsustainable and cannot be allowed to stand.”</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><u>Admission of Contents of Document in Pleadings</u></strong></p>
<p>In Perumal Chettiar v. Kamakshi Ammal, AIR 1938 Mad 785; (1938) 2 MLJ 189, it is observed, as to pleadings, as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“The result, in India, is that if by reason of the document being <span style="text-decoration: underline">unstamped,</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline">no evidence of its contents </span>whether primary or secondary is admissible, evidence of admissions by the defendant is equally inadmissible. The <span style="text-decoration: underline">position may be different where admissions are made in the pleadings </span>themselves (cf. Huddleston v, Briscoe (1805) 11 Ves. 583 (596) : 32 E.R. 1215 (1220) and Thynne v. Protheroe (1814) 2 M. &amp; S. 553 : 105 E.R. 488), <span style="text-decoration: underline">because by reason of Section 58 of the Evidence Act</span>, it may not be necessary to prove admitted facts and the objection under <span style="text-decoration: underline">Section 91 will not arise unless the plaintiff is called upon to go into evidence.</span> (Mallappa v. Mat an Naga Chetty (1918) 35 M.L.J. 555 : I.L.R. 42 Mad. 41 (F.B.)) </li>
<li>This was the position in Pramatha Nath Sandal v. Dwarka Nath Dey (1896) I.L.R. 23 Cal. 851;<span style="text-decoration: underline"> cf. however</span> Chenbasappa v. Lakshman Ramchandra (1893) I.L.R. 18 Bom. 369, where it was suggested that in a suit on an unstamped <span style="text-decoration: underline">promissory note, even an admission in the written statement may not avail </span>the plaintiff, as the Court when giving a decree on such admission may be “acting on” the document within the meaning of Section 35 of the Stamp Act; see also Ankur Chunder Roy Chowdhry v. Madhub Chunder Gkose (1873) 21 W.R. 1.”</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><u>Pay Duty With Penalty to Admit Unstamped Deed for Collateral Purpose</u></strong></p>
<p>In Yellapu Uma Maheswari v. Buddha Jagadheeswararao, (2015) 16 SCC 787, the Apex Court held in the suit for declaration of title that an unregistered document can be relied upon for collateral purposes i.e. to prove his possession, payment of sale consideration and nature of possession; but not for primary purpose i.e. sale between the plaintiff and defendant or its terms. It is held as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li class="has-small-font-size">“In a suit for partition, an unregistered document can be relied upon for collateral purpose i.e. severancy of title, nature of possession of various shares but not for the primary purpose i.e. division of joint properties by metes and bounds. An unstamped instrument is not admissible in evidence even for collateral purpose, until the same is impounded. Hence,<span style="text-decoration: underline"> if the appellant-defendant wants to mark these documents for collateral purpose it is open for them to pay the stamp duty together with penalty and (sic?) get the document impounded</span> and the trial court is at liberty to mark Exts. B-21 and B-22 for collateral purpose subject to proof and relevance.” </li>
</ul>
<p>Section 49 of the Registration Act expressly states admissibility of unregistered documents  in evidence for collateral purposes. The word ‘collateral’ signifies something beyond or parallel. According to Law Lexicon it means “that which is by the side, and not the direct line; that which is additional to or beyond a thing” (Amit Khanna.  Vs Suchi Khanna, 2008-10 ADJ 426; 2009-75 All LR 34; 2009-1 AWC 929).</p>
<p>The Apex Court in K.B. Saha and Sons Private Limitedv. Development Consultant Ltd., (2008) 8 SCC 564: 2008 AIR SCW 4829, has laid down the principle in respect of the collateral purpose.</p>
<ul class="has-small-font-size wp-block-list">
<li>       “34. From the principles laid down in the various decisions of this Court and the High Courts, as referred to here-in-above, it is evident that :-</li>
</ul>
<ol class="has-small-font-size wp-block-list">
<li>       A document required to be registered is not admissible into evidence under section 49 of the Registration Act.</li>
<li>      Such unregistered document can however be used as an evidence of collateral purpose as provided in the Proviso to section 49 of the Registration Act.</li>
<li>       A collateral transaction must be independent of, or divisible from, the transaction to effect which the law required registration.</li>
<li>      A collateral transaction must be a transaction not itself required to be effected by a registered document, that is, a transaction creating, etc. any right, title or interest in immovable property of the value of one hundred rupees and upwards.</li>
<li>     If a document is inadmissible in evidence for want of registration, none of its terms can be admitted in evidence and that to use a document for the purpose of proving an important clause would not be using it as a collateral purpose.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">Unstamped or Insufficiently Stamped Pro-note</span></strong></p>
<p>Unstamped or insufficiently stamped promissory note cannot be marked in evidence. The weight of authority is on the side that says it is incurable. Hence no secondary evidence can also be lead on the same. It cannot be used for collateral purpose also. But the creditor can prosecute a suit upon ‘original consideration’.</p>
<p><strong><u>N.N. Global held – If Arb. Agreement Unstamped – No ‘Valid arb. Agreement Exists’</u></strong></p>
<p>Before the 5-Judge-Bench of the Supreme Court, it was argued –</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>by the respondents/defendants, on the basis of the relevant provisions of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 (<span style="text-decoration: underline">especially Sec. 16</span>), that an arbitration clause would stand as a <span style="text-decoration: underline">distinct, separate and independent</span> from the substantive contract and that an arbitration reference can be made by the court even if the arbitration agreement was insufficiently stamped; and</li>
<li>by the appellant/plaintiff, in view of the provisions in the Indian Stamp Act (<span style="text-decoration: underline">especially Sec. 33 and 35</span>), that the arbitration <span style="text-decoration: underline">reference could not be made by the court on the basis of an insufficiently stamped agreement</span>. It was pointed out that unstamped or insufficiently stamped documents cannot be used as evidence for any purpose, as provided in the Stamp Act; and that for reference under Sec. 8 of the Arbitration Act the court has to specifically <strong>find that <em>prima facie</em> a “valid arbitration agreement exists</strong>“.</li>
</ul>
<p>It is held, by majority (3:2), in N.N. Global Mercantile (P) Ltd. v. Indo Unique Flame Ltd., 2023 SCC OnLine SC 495, that an arbitration reference cannot be made by the court under Sec. 8 of the Arb. Act, on the basis of an unstamped or insufficiently stamped agreement.</p>
<p>The Majority affirmed the findings in this regard, in the two earlier 3-Judge Bench decisions.</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>(i) Garware Wall Ropes Ltd. v. Coastal Marine Constructions &amp; Engg. Ltd., (2019) 9 SCC 209 (it was held that an arbitration reference cannot be made on the basis of an unstamped or insufficiently stamped agreement).</li>
<li>(ii) Vidya Drolia v. Durga Trading Corporation, 2021-2 SCC 1 (it was held that landlord-tenant disputes covered and governed by rent control legislation would not be arbitrable when specific court or forum has been given exclusive jurisdiction to apply and decide special rights and obligations).</li>

This duty is to be performed by the Judge irrespective of the fact whether any objection to its marking is raised or not. Hence, there is a need for diligence on the part of the Court having regard to the statutory obligation under Section 33 of the Karnataka Stamp Act. Section 34 of the Karnataka Stamp Act<strong><mark class="has-inline-color has-primary-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">*</mark></strong> mandates that an instrument, which is not duly stamped shall not be admitted in evidence. If any objection is taken to the admissibility of the evidence, it shall be decided then and there. If this document is found to be insufficiently stamped, then in terms of the proviso(a) to Section 34, the Court shall call upon the person, who is tendering the said document to pay duty and ten times penalty and thereafter admit the document in evidence. If duty and penalty is not paid, the document shall not be admitted in evidence.

<p><strong><u>Should the Court Sit Silent </u><span style="text-decoration: underline">and Question <strong>Unstamped Document</strong>s Afterwards</span></strong></p>
<p>Though Smt. Savithramma R.C v. M/s. Vijaya Bank (supra) clarified the position with great clarity. As shown above, it pointed out- </p>

</ul>
<p>Therefore, it is not definite- </p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>whether the court should be unfailingly  diligent enough not to mark an unstamped or insufficiently stamped document,or </li>
<li>whether the court should sit silent and mark the document if it is not opposed, or </li>
<li>whether the court should raise its eye-brows after marking it unopposed.</li>
</ul>
<p>It is yet to be solved after considering all relevant aspects.</p>
<p>Referring Sec. 36 of the (Indian) Stamp Act, Karnataka High Court pointed out in Nanda Behera v. Akhsaya Kumar Behera, 2017AIR (CC) 1893,  relying on Javer Chand v. Pukhraj Surana, AIR 1961 SC 1655, and Yellapu Uma Maheswari v. Buddha Jagadheeswara Rao, (2015) 16 SCC 787, as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li class="has-small-font-size">“12. Thus where a question as to the admissibility of a document is raised on the ground that it has not been stamped or has not been properly stamped, it has to be decided then and there when the document is tendered in evidence. Once the Court, rightly or wrongly, decides to admit the document in evidence, <span style="text-decoration: underline">so far as the parties are concerned, the matter is closed</span>. Parties to a litigation, where such a controversy is raised, have to be circumspect and the party challenging the admissibility of the document has to be alert to see that the document is not admitted in evidence by the Court. The Court has to judicially determine the matter as soon as the document is tendered in evidence and before it is marked as an exhibit. Once a document has been admitted in evidence, it is not open either to the trial court itself or to a Court of Appeal or revision to go behind that order. Such an order is not one of those judicial orders which are liable to be reviewed or revised by the same Court or a Court of superior jurisdiction. An unregistered document can be relied upon for collateral purpose i.e. severancy of title, nature of possession of various shares but not for the primary purpose i.e. division of joint properties by metes and bounds. An unstamped instrument is not admissible in evidence even for collateral purpose, until the same is impounded. <span style="text-decoration: underline">If the petitioner wants to mark the documents for collateral purpose, it is open to him to pay the stamp duty together with penalty</span> and get the document impounded. Thereafter the trial court shall consider the same for collateral purpose subject to proof and relevance.”</li>

<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">Is Impounding “Totally</span></strong> <span style="font-weight: bold;text-decoration: underline">Different</span><strong>“<span style="text-decoration: underline"> </span><span style="text-decoration: underline">from Admissibility</span></strong></p>
<p>Sec. 36 of the stamp Act  deals with and bar <strong>questioning ‘</strong><mark class="has-inline-color has-primary-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><strong>admission of instrument</strong></mark><mark class="has-inline-color has-foreground-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">‘, alone.</mark><mark class="has-inline-color has-primary-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><strong> </strong></mark>That interdiction or bar applies to the courts also.</p>
<p>Karnataka High Court (N. Kumar, J.), in Rekha S. Chandru v. Chikka Venkatappa (2015), authoritatively held relying on Javer Chand v. Pukhraj Surana, AIR 1961 SC 1655, that when a document was already marked by the trial Court in evidence, the objection regarding stamp duty cannot be raised at a later stage. It further observed (obiter) by the Karnataka High Court that the <span style="text-decoration: underline">impounding the document was “totally different” from admissibility</span>; and therefore, an insufficiently stamped document, if admitted by mistake, was liable to be impounded by the Court and the procedure prescribed in the Stamp Act was to be followed in so far as collection of stamp duty and penalty were concerned.</p>
<p>In principle, no doubt, what is said by the Karnataka High Court is fully legally acceptable.  But, it can be argued that the above proposition requires evaluation on the touchstone of the Apex Court verdict,  <strong>Javer Chand v. Pukhraj Surana</strong>, AIR 1961 SC 1655, which reads as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li class="has-small-font-size">“<span style="text-decoration:underline">Once a document has been admitted</span> in evidence, as aforesaid, it is <span style="text-decoration:underline">not open </span>either to the Trial Court itself or to a Court of <span style="text-decoration: underline">Appeal or revision </span><span style="text-decoration:underline">to go behind that order.</span><span style="text-decoration: underline"> Such an order is not one of those judicial orders</span> which are <span style="text-decoration: underline">liable to be reviewed</span> or revised by the same Court or a Court of superior jurisdiction.”</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">Should an opportunity be given to Cure Defect, by Paying Deficit Stamp Duty?</span></strong></p>
<p>In Kalaivani @ Devasena v. J. Ramu, 2010(1) CTC 27,  it was held that an opportunity should be given to the party who produces the document with insufficient stamp, to pay the deficit stamp duty and penalty so that the document could be exhibited; and that if penalty is not paid, the document should be impounded. It is held as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li class="has-small-font-size">“24. .. It is well settled that even an unregistered document is admissible in evidence for collateral purpose provided it is adequately stamped under the Stamp act. If the document is both unstamped and unregistered, as the document in question here, it is no doubt true that it cannot be looked into for collateral purpose also. But such a document should not be thrown out at the threshold itself and an opportunity must be extended to the party who wants to mark the document on his side by directing him to pay the deficit stamp duty along with the penalty upto date, then the document could be admitted in evidence for collateral purpose. If the person does not pay the Court, then the document is to be impounded and sent to the Collector for taking action under the law.”</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration:underline">Conclusion</span></strong> </p>
<p>It is not at all fair to say that if the court inadvertently marked a document or it failed to object marking, the document will stand good in favour of the party who tendered the document. </p>
