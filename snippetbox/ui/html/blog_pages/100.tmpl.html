<p><strong><u> Apex Court Ordered to Give-Back Land</u></strong></p>
<p>Our Apex Court ordered to give back the properties acquired, in Uddar Gagan Properties Limited vs. Sant Singh, (2016) 11 SCC 378 and Royal Orchid Hotels Limited vs. G. Jayarama Reddy, (2011) 10 SCC 608<strong> </strong>to its prior owners on the ground that the proceedings were vitiated by fraud and there was colourable exercise of power.</p>
<p><u>Uddar Gagan Properties Ltd. case</u></p>
<p>Uddar Gagan Properties Ltd., entered into collusive agreements with some of the farmers/owners whilst the acquisition proceedings were under way. Pointing out that the acquisition in that case was not completed and the title did not vest in the State, the Apex Court held that the entire administrative action could be held to be vitiated by fraud and there was colourable exercise of power.</p>
<p><u>Royal Orchid Hotels Limited</u></p>
<p>In the case of Royal Orchid Hotels Limited the Apex Court found the entire exercise was fraudulent and colourable exercise of power. In the facts of the case the Apex Court found that fraud unravels everything and upon diversion of the public purpose, the acquisition proceedings were liable to be quashed; and the land was ordered to be returned to the original land owners in spite of their having earlier accepted the compensation.</p>
<p><u>Mr. Felton Fernandes Vs. Union of India</u></p>
<p>The aforesaid two decisions of the Apex Court were distinguished by the  Bombay High Court, in Mr. Felton Fernandes Vs. Union of India, 2018(5) ALL MR 886, related to the land acquisition for Chhatrapati Shivaji International Airport (formerly known as Sahar International Airport) at Bombay.</p>
<p>The petitioners argued before the High Court that though the land was acquired for public purpose, it was diverted from the public purpose and utilised for a private and purely commercial user. According to them it was a fraudulent action and called for quashing of the acquisition. They further contended, relying on Uddar Gagan Properties Limited vs. Sant Singh and Royal Orchid Hotels Limited vs. G. Jayarama Reddy that this land was no longer to be used for a public purpose, and therefore it must be reverted to the original owners. But, the High Court held that even when a land acquired by State was utilised by the State for private commercial purpose, there is no provision in law, which enabled the prior owner of the land to reclaim same. The court pointed out that the operator of airport had been given permission for exploiting the land forming part of project for ancillary uses; and that such user could not be termed as fraudulent so as to vitiate original acquisition of land. And that once land vested in State under Sec.7, the State could not be divested of its title for non-user of land for purpose for which it was acquired, and therefore the acquisition notification could not be quashed. The High Court relied on Gulam Mustafa vs. State of Maharashtra, (1976) 1 SCC 800:   AIR 1977 SC 448, which held as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“5. At this stage Shri Deshpande complained that actually the municipal committee had sold away the excess land marking them out into separate plots for a housing colony. Apart from the fact that a housing colony is a public necessity, once the original acquisition is valid and title has vested in the municipality, how it uses the excess land is no concern of the original owner and cannot be the basis for invalidating the acquisition. <span style="text-decoration:underline">There is no principle of law by which a valid compulsory acquisition stands voided because long after the requiring authority diverts it to a public purpose other than the once stated in the Section 9(3) declaration</span>.”</li>
</ul>
<p>The Bombay High Court noticed that it was inconceivable that when the original acquisition was made in 1953 under Sec. 7 of the Act, there was any plan for diversion of use of the land for any private purpose, and it could not be termed as fraudulent.</p>
