</ul>
<p><strong>“<span style="text-decoration: underline">W</span><u>hich the owner or occupier of certain land possesses</u>”</strong></p>
<p>Sec. 12 states that an easement is acquired by the owner of an immovable property. Sec. 21 lays down that an easement must not be used for any purpose not connected with enjoyment of the dominant heritage. It cannot be severed from dominant heritage.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration:underline"><strong>‘Enjoyment’ of ‘Land’ </strong></span></p>
<p>Easements are limited to ‘enjoyment of’ Servient ‘land’ (and things ‘subsisting’, for land includes things permanently attached to earth).</p>
<p>“<span style="text-decoration:underline"><strong>For the <strong><mark class="has-inline-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#9732f6"><span style="text-decoration: underline">beneficial enjoymen</span></mark></strong><span style="text-decoration: underline"><mark class="has-inline-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#9732f6">t</mark></span> of that Land</strong>.</span>“</p>
<p>The most outstanding clause in the definition of easement is “Beneficial Enjoyment”.</p>
<p>Easements are <em>primarily</em> for the <strong><mark class="has-inline-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#9732f6"><span style="text-decoration: underline">beneficial enjoymen</span></mark></strong><span style="text-decoration: underline"><mark class="has-inline-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#9732f6">t</mark></span> of dominant heritage. Easement stands as part and parcel of dominant land. The definition says that an easement is a ‘right which the owner or occupier of certain land possesses, as such’. </p>
<p>“<strong><span style="text-decoration:underline">As Such</span></strong>“</p>
<p>‘As such’ is used for emphasis to convey that easement is <em>essentially</em> connected to the dominant land, and it is <em>inherently</em> for the <mark class="has-inline-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#9732f6"><span style="text-decoration: underline">beneficial enjoymen</span></mark><span style="text-decoration: underline"><mark class="has-inline-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#9732f6">t</mark></span> of annexed/appertained (dominant) land; and <span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>not</strong> a right ‘<strong>in gross</strong>’ (for the benefit of individuals)</span>.</p>
<p><strong><u><strong><u><strong><u>Profit-a-prendre – Indian Law Varies from</u><span style="text-decoration: underline"> English Law</span></strong></u></strong></u></strong></p>
<p>Under English Law, an easement is a privilege alone; and profit-a-prendre (right to take) is not an easement. It does not allow “<mark class="has-inline-color has-primary-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Removal and Appropriation</strong></span></mark>” also.  The Indian Easements Act purposefully used “to do something in or upon”, decisively avoiding, ‘to use’ or ‘to enjoy’; because, Indian Law allows ‘<strong>profit-a-prendre</strong>‘ [fishing, pasturing, grass-cutting for thatching, etc.]. It is allowed on Indian situations – but, without conferring substantial interest in the servient land. ‘Profit a predre’ is not appurtenant to any dominant land; and it is a right ‘in gross’ (for the benefit of individuals).</p>
<p>‘<mark class="has-inline-color has-primary-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong><mark class="has-inline-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#9732f6"><span style="text-decoration: underline">Beneficial Enjoymen</span></mark></strong><span style="text-decoration: underline"><mark class="has-inline-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#9732f6">t</mark></span></span></mark>‘ <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">in Easement includes</span> </strong>“<mark class="has-inline-color has-primary-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Removal and Appropriation</strong></span></mark>“</p>
<p>The Explanation to the definition of Easement (in Sec. 4) reads as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“Explanation – In the first and second clauses of this section, the expression “land” includes also things permanently attached to the earth;</li>
<li>the expression “<strong><mark class="has-inline-color has-primary-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><span style="text-decoration: underline">beneficial enjoymen</span></mark></strong><span style="text-decoration: underline"><mark class="has-inline-color has-primary-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">t</mark></span>” includes also <mark class="has-inline-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#1106cd">possible convenience, remote advantage, and even a mere amenity</mark>; </li>

<p> <span style="text-decoration:underline"><strong>The word ‘Servient’ is derived from ‘Servant’</strong> </span></p>
<p> Literal meaning of the word ‘servient’ is – subordinate, subservient and subject to another. Etymologically it is derived from ‘servus’ (Latin) meaning – slave or servant.</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“<span style="text-decoration:underline">Dominant and Servient Heritages and Owners<strong>: </strong></span>The land for the <strong><mark class="has-inline-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#9732f6"><span style="text-decoration: underline">beneficial enjoymen</span></mark></strong><span style="text-decoration: underline"><mark class="has-inline-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#9732f6">t</mark></span>  of which the right exists is called the dominant heritage, and the owner or occupier thereof the dominant owner; the land on which the liability is imposed is called the servient heritage, and the owner or occupier thereof the servient owner.”</li>

<p>Thus, the land upon which the right is claimed is ‘servient’ land. </p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration:underline">Easement is acquired; not arise out of ‘Express Permission’</span></strong></p>
<p>Sec. 12, Easements Act states that an easement is <span style="text-decoration:underline">acquired</span>  (under grant, partition or prescription) by the owner of an immovable property. Section 12, Indian Easements Act, 1882 reads as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>12.</strong> <u>Who may acquire easements</u>-An easement may be <u>acquired</u> by the owner of the immovable property for the <strong><mark class="has-inline-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#9732f6"><span style="text-decoration: underline">beneficial enjoymen</span></mark></strong><span style="text-decoration: underline"><mark class="has-inline-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#9732f6">t</mark></span> of which the right is created, or on his behalf, by any person in possession of the same.</li>
<li>One of two or more co-owners of immovable property may, as such, with or without the consent of the other or others, acquire an easement for the <strong><mark class="has-inline-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#9732f6"><span style="text-decoration: underline">beneficial enjoymen</span></mark></strong><span style="text-decoration: underline"><mark class="has-inline-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#9732f6">t</mark></span> of such property.</li>
<li>No lessee of immovable property can acquire, for the <strong><mark class="has-inline-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#9732f6"><span style="text-decoration: underline">beneficial enjoymen</span></mark></strong><span style="text-decoration: underline"><mark class="has-inline-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#9732f6">t</mark></span> of other immovable property of his own, an easement in or over the property comprised in his lease.</li>
</ul>
<p>It is observed by the Apex Court in <strong>Bachhaj Nahar Vs. Nilima Mandal</strong>, AIR 2009 SC 1103, that the claimant of easement (prescription) should plead and prove that the right claimed was enjoyed <span style="text-decoration:underline">independent of any agreement</span> with the owner of the property over which the right is claimed, as any user with the <span style="text-decoration:underline">express permission</span> of the owner will be a licence and not an easement. </p>
<p><strong><u>Methods of Acquisition of Easements</u></strong></p>
<p>The Indian Easements Act, 1882 refers to the different methods by which easements are acquired. They are pointed out (<strong>Ramkanya Bai v. Jagdish</strong>, AIR 2011 SC 3258) to be the following:</p>
<ol class="wp-block-list" style="list-style-type:1">
<li>easements by <span style="text-decoration:underline">grant</span>: <strong>express grant</strong> by the owner of the servient heritage</li>
<li>easements of <span style="text-decoration:underline">necessity:</span> based on <strong>implied grants</strong> or reservations made by the owner of a servient heritage at the time of transfers or partitions</li>
<li>easements by <span style="text-decoration:underline">prescription:</span> it is <strong>presumed</strong> that it is <span style="text-decoration: underline">acquired</span> by peaceable and open enjoyment, without interruption for twenty years and</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration:underline">custom</span><span style="text-decoration: underline">ary</span> easements: it is <strong>inferred</strong> that it is <span style="text-decoration: underline">acquired</span> by virtue of a local custom.</li>
</ol>
<p>For easement by prescription, it is not necessary that the user should be exclusive, but the claimant should exercise it under some claim existing in his own favour independently of all others.</p>
<p><strong><u>Basis of Every Right of Easement Is Theoretically a Grant</u></strong></p>
<p>The origin of all easements is, theoretically, grant by the servient owner. It may be express or implied. It may also be presumed from long user. It is observed in <strong>Sree Swayam Prakash Ashramam v. G. Anandavally Amma</strong>, AIR 2010 SC 622, as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li class="has-small-font-size">“Theoretically all easements have their origin in some sort of grant by the servient owner. The grant may be <span style="text-decoration:underline">express </span>or it may be <span style="text-decoration:underline">implied </span>from the surrounding attendant circumstances and conduct of the parties or it may even be <span style="text-decoration:underline">presumed</span> from long user. In the case of an express grant of easement the limit thereof depends on the words used.”</li>
</ul>
<p>In Lachhi v. Ghansara Singh, AIR 1972 HP 89, it is held as under:</p>
<p>The basis of every right of easement is theoretically a ‘grant’ from the servient-owner. </p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>It may be <span style="text-decoration:underline">expressed</span>, as in Sections 8 to 12 of the Act; or </li>
<li>it may be <span style="text-decoration:underline">implied </span>from the circumstances as in Section 13 of the Act; or </li>
<li>it may be <span style="text-decoration:underline">presumed</span> from long and continued user for a certain period as in Section 15 of the Act; or </li>
<li>it may be <span style="text-decoration:underline">inferred</span> from a long and continued practice of <span style="text-decoration:underline">user by a certain class of the public</span> in certain locality.</li>
</ul>
<p>For easement by prescription, it is not necessary that the user should be exclusive, but the claimant should exercise it under some claim existing in his own favour independently of all others.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration:underline">Grant by a Co-owner</span></strong></p>
<p>Grant effected by a co-owner with the consent of other co-owners, or validated by their approval or ratification, alone is valid. In proper cases such consent or ratification may be presumed.  </p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration:underline">Lost Grant</span></strong></p>
<p>In Easements Act by Dr. Karandikar &amp; Chitaley at Page 425, note 20 (Title by lost grant), it is observed as follows:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“(2) The evidence from which a lost grant may be inferred is not very different from the evidence on which a claim for a prescriptive easement may be established.</li>
<li>(3) (Drainage system of defendant’s building connected with sewer line of plaintiff’s building – Right claimed by defendant exercised secretly – Held, right was not proved.) The presumption of lost grant may be negatived by showing legal incompetence as regards owner of the servient tenement to grant an easement or a physical incapacity of being obstructed as regard the easement itself or an uncertainty or secrecy of enjoyment putting out of the category of all known easements.</li>
<li>(4) Where the plaintiff did make out a case of user from time immemorial in the plaint a decree could be granted on the basis of lost grant.</li>
<li>(5) Acquisition of easement by immemorial user based on doctrine of lost grant can be claimed when dominant and servient tenements are held under same landlord.</li>
<li>(6) Proof of the origin of right or by such proof of long &amp; uninterrupted usage as in the absence of a documentary title will suffice to establish a prescriptive right.” (Quoted in Varghese v. Jose Mathew, 2014-3 Ker LT 1065).</li>
</ul>
<p>In Halsbury’s Laws of England Vol 16(2) at Page 42, paragraph 76, it is observed as follows:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“76. Prescription based on presumed grant. The doctrine of prescription generally is based upon the presumption of a grant, the common law doctrine being that all prescription presupposes a grant once made and validly subsisting, but since lost or destroyed. The other forms of prescription are merely modifications of this doctrine. The presumption in the former instance of such a grant arises under the doctrine of prescription from the fact of enjoyment of the right. It therefore follows that a right claimed by prescription must be such that it could have formed the subject matter of a grant. Nothing which cannot have had a lawful beginning can be claimed by prescription. Recourse can only be had to the doctrine of prescription in cases where a grant of the right is not forthcoming, for <span style="text-decoration:underline">prescription has no place if a grant is proved and its terms are known</span>“. (Quoted in Varghese v. Jose Mathew, 2014-3 Ker LT 1065).</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Extent of Easement</strong> –<strong> If used for several purposes, inferred for all purposes</strong></span></p>
<p>Under the provisions of the Easements Act, the dominant owner cannot –</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>enlarge purpose of, or accustomed, user (<strong>S. 28</strong>) and</li>
<li>substantially increase an easement (<strong>S. 29</strong>).</li>
</ul>
<p>In Cowling v Higginson (1838) 4 M &amp; W 245, it was held as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“If a way has been used for several purposes, there may be a ground for inferring that there is a right of way for all purposes.”</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">Extent of Easement</span></strong></p>
<p>The courts in India took the stand that easement for one purpose can be changed to another, provided there is no additional burden (agricultural purposes might be used for the purpose of a factory provided no additional burden). See:</p>

</ul>
<p>Our Courts followed the principles laid down in the following English cases-</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline">Williams v. James: [1867] LR 2 CP 57</span>7, held that ‘a right of way obtained by prescription for the purpose of carting hay to field ‘c<span style="text-decoration: underline">annot be increased so </span>as to affect the servient tenement by <span style="text-decoration: underline">imposing upon it any additional burthen’</span>.</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>This decision is followed in Jotindra Mohan Mitter v. Probodh Kumar Dutt, AIR 1932 Cal 249, and it was held –</li>
<li>“In ascertaining the extent of the right of user of a road when the condition of the adjoining property has been altered, the fact that there was plenty of room in the road had never been taken into consideration. The right must be measured according to the principle laid down by Wills, J., in Williams v. James [1867] 2 C.P. 577 as a <span style="text-decoration: underline">reasonable use</span> for the purpose of the land in the condition in which it was when the user took place, that is in the case of this mansion, in the state in which it was when the grant was made. <span style="text-decoration: underline">The matter must however be looked at <strong>reasonably</strong>, and no small addition to the house would be improper.</span> Here there had been a very large increase.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">Wimbledon and Putney Commons Conservators v. Dixon: (1875) 1 Ch D 362</span></strong>, held that ‘if a right of way to a field be <span style="text-decoration: underline">proved by evidence of user,</span> however general, <span style="text-decoration: underline">for whatever purpose qua field, the person who is the owner of that field cannot from that say, I have a right to turn that field into a manufactory</span>, or into a town, and then use the way for the purpose of the manufactory or town so built.’</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>This decision is followed in Manchersha Sorabji Shet v. Virijvalavdas Jekisandas, (1926) 28 BomLR 1158, and it was held –</li>
<li>“In Wimbledon and Putney Commons Conservators v. Dixon (1875) 1 Ch D 362 it was held that the immemorial user of a right of way for all purposes for which a road was wanted in the then condition of the property, does not establish a right of way for all purposes in an altered condition of the property where that would impose a greater burden on the servient tenement. Where a road had been immemorially used to a farm not only for usual agricultural purposes, but in certain instances for carrying <span style="text-decoration: underline">building materials to enlarge the farm-house</span> and rebuild a cottage on the farm, and for carting away sand and gravel dug out of the farm, it was decided that those circumstances did not establish a right of way for carting the materials required for building a number of new houses on the land.”</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">Corporation of London v. Riggs (1880) 13 Ch. D. 798</span></strong>, held that a right of way of necessity is not a general right “for all purposes”; it is limited to the uses to which it had been put at the time <span style="text-decoration: underline">when the action first arose or when the way of necessity was created.</span> </p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>This decision is followed in Manchersha Sorabji Shet v. Virijvalavdas Jekisandas, (1926) 28 BomLR 1158, and it was held –</li>
<li>“Again, in Corporation of London v. Riggs (1880) 13 Ch.D. 798 the head-note runs as follows :- Where the owner of a close surrounded by his own land grants the land and reserves the close, the implied right to a way of necessity to and from the close over the land operates by way of re-grant from the grantee of the land, and is limited by the necessity which created it.”</li>

<p>In other words-</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Can one claim ‘easement of necessity’ and ‘easement by prescription’ with respect to a (same) way?  </li>
<li>Does a way  that started with minimum width (say a foot-path) under the claim ‘easement of necessity’, and continued with a higher width (so that cars can be taken), in the course of time,  for more than 20 years, will yield or bring-in ‘easement by prescription’?</li>
</ul>
<p>We find answer in negative form in Tanba Nusaji Mahajan v, Pandhari Mahajan, 2004 (6) BomCR 782, 2004 (4) MhLJ 109. It is held as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“10. However, a way of necessity is distinguished from the right of way acquired by prescription and <span style="text-decoration: underline">cannot ripen into a prescriptive easement so long as the necessity continues</span>. A way of necessity arises by virtue of conditions entirely different from easement of way created by prescription. The former arises by implication of law out of the necessities of the case and is based upon principle of law which negative the existence of a way by continuous adverse user. The acquisition of way by adverse user is based upon the theory of the hostility of the use to the title of the person over whose lands it is acquired, while a way of necessity is based upon an implication of an intended grant and the use of it is based entirely upon such implication or consent to its use.”</li>

<p><strong><u>Implied Grant and Quasi Easement in a ‘Formed’ Way</u></strong></p>
<p>There could be no implied grant where the easements are not continuous and non-apparent. But, in Sree Swayam Prakash Ashramam v. G. Anandavally Amma, AIR 2010 SC 622, our Apex Court found <strong><u>quasi easement under Section 13(b)</u></strong> of the Indian Easements Act over a way in the following circumstances –</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Though there could be no implied grant where the easements are not continuous and non-apparent, if there is a <strong><u>‘formed road’</u></strong> existing over one part of the tenement for the apparent use of another portion or there is ‘some permanence in the adaptation of the tenement’ from which continuity may be inferred, an exception can be inferred (Annapurna Dutta vs. Santosh Kumar Sett, AIR 1937 Cal.661, B.K. Mukherjee, referred to).</li>
<li>There was <strong>implied grant of ‘B’ schedule property as pathway</strong><strong>,</strong> which can be <strong><u>inferred from the circumstances</u></strong> for the reason that <strong>no other pathway</strong> was provided for access to dominant property and there was <strong>no objection </strong>also to the use of disputed way by the plaintiff.</li>
<li>An <strong>easement may arise by implication</strong>, if the intention to grant can properly be <strong>inferred</strong> either<strong> from</strong> the terms of the grant or the <strong>circumstances</strong>.</li>
<li><strong><u>A trace of the pathway could be presumed</u></strong> to be in existence from the time when the plaintiff acquired the properties by separation of tenements.</li>
<li>Only access to the property was through disputed pathway.</li>
<li>It was required for the reasonable and convenient use of the plaintiff’s property and that on severance of the tenements, <strong><u>plaintiff can be presumed to have got a right over disputed pathway</u></strong> <strong><u>by an implied grant</u></strong> and also an easement of necessity.</li>
<li>The user was not obstructed for very long time.</li>
<li>There was no reason to disbelieve the plaintiff’s version that disputed way was given as grant for his use as he was a close relative of the former.</li>
<li>There was an <strong><u>apparent and continuous use which was necessary for the enjoyment of the `A’ schedule property</u></strong> <strong><u>within the meaning of Section 13(b)</u></strong> of the Indian Easements Act.</li>
<li>The defendants have not entered the witness box to disprove the evidence led by the plaintiff.</li>
<li>Therefore, the plaintiff was entitled to easement right in respect of the pathway.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><u><strong><u>Easement of Necessity</u></strong> is limited to Barest Necessity, however inconvenient it is</u></strong></p>
<p>In Hero Vinoth (Minor) vs. Seshammal, (2006) 5 SCC 545, AIR 2006 SC 2234, our Apex Court held as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“An <strong><u>easement of necessity</u></strong> is one which is not merely necessary for the reasonable enjoyment of the dominant tenement, but one where dominant tenement cannot be used at all without the easement. The burden of the servient owner in such a case is not on the basis of any concession or grant made by him for consideration or otherwise, but it is by way of a legal obligation enabling the dominant owner to use his land. <strong><u>It is limited to the barest necessity</u></strong> <strong><u>however inconvenient it is</u></strong> irrespective of the question whether a better access could be given by the servient owner or not. When an alternate access becomes available, the legal necessity of burdening the servient owner ceases and the easement of necessity by implication of law is legally withdrawn or extinguished as statutorily recognized in Section 41. Such an easement will last only as long as the absolute necessity exists. Such a legal extinction cannot apply to an acquisition by grant and Section 41 is not applicable in such case.”</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><u>Who has the Burden to show Alternate Way </u></strong></p>
<p>In <strong>Sree Swayam Prakash Ashramam v. G. Anandavally Amma</strong>, AIR 2010 SC 622, it is held that the plaintiff claiming easement of necessity or grant has only a primary burden to prove the absence of any alternate pathway. </p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“In a case where the original plaintiff was claiming easement right either as grant or as of necessity the <span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>plaintiff has only a primary burden </strong>to prove the <strong>absence of any alternate pathway</strong></span>. As the defendants have not proved the existence of any pathway for access to Plaint `A’ schedule property the version of the plaintiff that there is no alternate pathway shall be accepted. … <span style="text-decoration: underline">The defendants have not entered the witness box to disprove the evidence led by the plaintiff.</span>”</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><u>Who has the Onus to show Alternate Way Could Not be Used ‘As Of Right’</u></strong></p>
<p>When the existence of alternate way is shown by the alleged servient owner of easement of necessity, the onus to prove that the way cannot be used “as of right” is upon the dominant owner. In Antony @ Anthappan v. George,  LAWS(KER) 2012-11-179 it is held by t6he Kerala High Court as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“11. When the existence of an alternate way is shown, the appellants ought to have shown that they could not use it <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">as of right</span></strong>. That is because that is a matter within the knowledge of the appellants. <span style="text-decoration: underline">The appellants did not adduce evidence in that line</span>.”</li>
</ul>
<p>The High Court then remanded the case giving the dominant owners an opportunity to adduce evidence to show that the alternate way was not one which they were entitled to use as of right.</p>
<p><strong><u>Pleaded ‘Grant’; Not, Implied Grant – Apex Court, allowed Implied Grant</u></strong></p>
<p>Though the plaintiff pleaded only ‘Grant’, and not, Implied Grant,  our Apex Court,  in Sree Swayam Prakash Ashramam v. G. Anandavally Amma, AIR 2010 SC 622, allowed Implied Grant observing as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“It is true that the defendant/appellant alleged that no implied grant was pleaded in the plaint. The Trial Court, in our view, was justified in holding that such pleadings were not necessary when it did not make a difference to the finding arrived at with respect to the easement by way of grant. Accordingly, there is no substance in the argument raised by the learned senior counsel for the appellants.”</li>

<p><strong><u>Plea of Title and Adverse Possession</u> – <u>Whether Mutually Contradictory</u></strong>?</p>
<p>In Government of Kerala v. Joseph, AIR 2023 SC 3988, it is held as under: </p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“21.9 Claim of independent title and adverse possession at the same time amount to <strong><u>contradictory pleas</u></strong>. The case of Annasaheb Bapusaheb Patil v. Balwant, (1995) 2 SCC 543 elaborated this principle as:</li>
<li>“15. Where possession can be referred to a lawful title, it will not be considered to be adverse. The reason being that a person whose possession can be referred to a lawful title <strong><u>will not be permitted to show</u></strong> that his possession was hostile to another’s title. One who holds possession on behalf of another, does not by mere denial of that other’s title make his possession adverse so as to give himself the benefit of the statute of limitation. Therefore, a person who enters into possession having a lawful title, cannot divest another of that title by pretending that he had no title at all.”</li>
<li>This principle was upheld in the case of Mohan Lal v. Mirza Abdul Gaffar (AIR 1996 SC 910, 1996 1 SCC 639 – two Judge Bench) –</li>
<li>“4. As regards the first plea, it is <strong><u>inconsistent</u></strong> with the second plea. Having come into possession under the agreement, he must disclaim his right thereunder and plead and prove assertion of his independent hostile adverse possession <strong><u>to the knowledge of the transferor</u></strong> or his successor in title or interest and that the latter had acquiesced to his illegal possession during the entire period of 12 years, i.e., up to completing the period of his title by prescription nec vi, nec clam, nec precario. Since the appellant’s claim is founded on Section 53-A, it goes without saying that he admits by implication that he came into possession of the land lawfully under the agreement and continued to remain in possession till date of the suit. Thereby the plea of adverse possession is not available to the appellant.”</li>
<li>The Court in Uttam Chand (Sri Uttam Chand v.  Nathu Ram AIR 2020 SC 461) has reiterated this principle of adverse possession.”</li>

<p><strong><u>Profit-a-prendre – Indian Law Varies from</u><span style="text-decoration: underline"> English Law</span></strong></p>
<p>Explanation to Sec. 4 of the Indian Easements Act, 1882 reads as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“Explanation – In the first and second clauses of this section, the expression “land” includes also things permanently attached to the earth; the expression “<strong><mark class="has-inline-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#9732f6"><span style="text-decoration: underline">beneficial enjoymen</span></mark></strong><span style="text-decoration: underline"><mark class="has-inline-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#9732f6">t</mark></span>” includes also possible convenience, remote advantage, and even a mere amenity; and the expression “to do something” includes removal and appropriation by the dominant owner, for the <strong><mark class="has-inline-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#9732f6"><span style="text-decoration: underline">beneficial enjoymen</span></mark></strong><span style="text-decoration: underline"><mark class="has-inline-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#9732f6">t</mark></span> of the dominant heritage, of any part of the soil of the servient heritage, or anything growing or subsisting thereon.”</li>
</ul>
<p>From the above Explanation it is clear that easement includes appropriation of certain tangible material things or natural resources (<strong><u>Profit-a-Prendre</u></strong>). They are further made clear by the Illustrations to various sections as shown under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Illustn.-(d) of S.4. It speaks as to <strong>Graze cattle, take water</strong> and <strong>fish out</strong> from the tank, <strong>take timber from wood,</strong> <strong>take fallen leaves for manuring</strong>.</li>
<li>Illustn.- (b) of S. 22. It states about <strong>cutting  thatching- grass</strong>. </li>
<li>Illustn.- (a) of S. 24. It refers to easement to <strong>lay pipes</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Hence, it is clear: Easement is not a mere ‘Privilege’; but, it includes:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>limited (legally-recognised) enjoyment /user/interest in serviant heritage, and</li>
<li>a right for (expressly-recognised) profit.</li>
</ul>
<p>Though Profit-a-prendre is allowed by Indian law considering the peculiarities of Indian situations, it is not a corporeal right.  And, it does not allow maintaining a substantial interest over the servient land.  No profit-a-prendre in gross also, i.e., for the benefit of individuals. On a close look, it can be seen that it is substantially related to ‘user’ of servient land.</p>
<p><strong><u>“To do do something &amp; ‘Removal and Appropriation</u></strong>‘</p>
<p>In State of Bihar v. Subodh Gopal Bose, AIR 1968 SC 281, our Apex Court held as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“By the Explanation to Sec. 4 the expression “to do something” includes removal and appropriation by the dominant owner, for the <strong><mark class="has-inline-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#9732f6"><span style="text-decoration: underline">beneficial enjoymen</span></mark></strong><span style="text-decoration: underline"><mark class="has-inline-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#9732f6">t</mark></span> of the dominant heritage, of any part of the soil of the servient heritage, or anything growing or subsisting thereon. <span style="text-decoration: underline">A profit-a- prendre is therefore included in the definition of “easement” in Sec. 4 of the Indian Easements Act.</span> But an easement being a right which is super-added to the ordinary common law incidents of the ownership of a dominant tenement, and which connotes a corresponding burden on a servient tenement, can only be created by grant, or by statute.”</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><u>“In or upon, or in respect of, certain other land not his own”</u></strong></p>
<p>Easement is a right to do something in or upon land of another. Even if the easement involves ‘construction’, it should be of another; because, Sec. 4: Explanation reads: “land” includes also things permanently attached to earth.</p>
<p>If the subsisting-construction is made by, or it belongs to, dominant owner, no doubt, there will be no easement. [1987 (2) Ker LT 1037 (Bund); AIR 1915 PC 131 (Jetty); AIR 1971 SC 1878].</p>
<p><strong><u>Easement Not Allows to ‘Enjoy’ After Making a Construction</u></strong><em><strong> </strong></em><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>or Cultivation</strong> </span><em>.</em></p>
<p>Easement is a Right for ‘enjoyment’ of things ‘subsisting’.  It is a Right for limited enjoyment, and advantages arising from its situation; and it does not allow to build-and-enjoy. It is clear from Sec. 7 which indicates that easement is only a right for limited enjoyment of (a) land and (b) advantages arising from its situation. It is also clear from the Scheme of the Act as shown under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>S. 4</strong> An easement is a<em> ‘right </em>which the owner or occupier of certain land possesses’<em> <strong>“as such”</strong></em></li>
<li><strong>S.4: </strong>Illustn. (d):  Graze cattle, take water and fish out from the tank, take timber from wood, take fallen leaves for manuring .</li>
<li><strong>S. 7: </strong>Only a right for limited enjoyment of (a) land &amp; (b) advantages arising from its situation. (It is stated:  Easements are restrictions of (a) Exclusive right (of owner) to enjoy immovable property, (b) Rights to advantages arising from its situation)</li>
<li><strong>S. 12</strong> An easement is acquired by owner an immovable property.</li>
<li><strong>S. 17:</strong> Not a right – to tend to total destruction of the servient tenement. (2003 (1) KLT 320)</li>
<li><strong>S. 21</strong> An easement must not be used for any purpose not connected with enjoyment of the dominant heritage.</li>
<li><strong>S. 22:</strong> Exercise easement – least onerous to servient tenement (Illustn.- b: can cut thatching- grass, not to destroy plants)</li>
<li><strong>S. 23:</strong> Not to make additional burden (Illus.- b: not to advance eaves; Illus.- d: not another pollution)</li>
<li><strong>S. 24:</strong> Secure full enjoyment, but cause as little inconvenience.  Illus. (a) easement to lay pipes</li>
<li><strong>S. 27:</strong> Servient owner is entitled to use – consistent with  easement</li>
<li><strong>S. 28:</strong> Easements of  necessity, Right of way, Other prescriptive rights <span style="text-decoration: underline">not to</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline">enlarge purpose</span>, accustomed user etc.</li>
<li><strong>S. 29:</strong> Dominant owner <span style="text-decoration: underline">Cannot substantially increase an easement</span></li>
<li><strong>S. 31:</strong> If excessive user – servient owner may obstruct the user.</li>
<li><strong>S. 43:</strong> Permanent change in the dominant heritage and the burden increased – easement is extinguished</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><u><span class="uppercase">Customary Easements</span></u></strong></p>
<p>Section 18 of the Easement Act reads as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“<span style="text-decoration:underline">18. Customary <span class="uppercase">e</span>asements</span>. An easement may be acquired in virtue of a local custom. Such easements are called customary easements.”</li>
</ul>
<p>Both custom and easement are involved in customary easement. In other words, when customary easement is claimed, elements of both custom and prescriptive easement are to be proved (Lachhi v. Ghansara Singh, AIR 1972 HP 89). In customary easements there need not be any ‘dominant tenement’. It is a right ‘in gross’ (to many).  Customary easements also does not allow to ‘construct and use’.</p>
<p><strong><u>Acquiring Customary Easement by One Person or a Fluctuating Body</u></strong></p>
<p>Illustration (a) to sec. 18 runs as follows:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“By the custom of a certain village every cultivator of village land is entitled, as such, to grass his cattle on the common pasture. A having become the tenant of a plot of uncultivated land in the village, breaks up and cultivates that plot. He thereby acquires an easement to graze his cattle in accordance with the customs.”</li>
</ul>
<p>A customary easement can be claimed by a family or an individual, and such claim need not be by a large community alone (R. Venkateswara Raju v. State of AP, 2020 Supreme (AP) 206). To constitute a customary easement the right claimed must be an easement and it must be in virtue of a local custom. A customary right of uninterrupted user is quite different from setting up a local custom.</p>
<p>It is also pointed out that different persons may have a right of pasture over a land, but the plaintiff can nonetheless claim a right independent of others, provided the necessary conditions are satisfied. A customary easement, as is obvious, embraces the needs of variable persons belonging to a class or locality, while a right by prescription is always personal. Therefore, customary easement is unappurtenant to any dominant tenement, or it has no relation to the <strong><mark class="has-inline-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#9732f6"><span style="text-decoration: underline">beneficial enjoymen</span></mark></strong><span style="text-decoration: underline"><mark class="has-inline-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#9732f6">t</mark></span> of a dominant tenement as required in easement. A fluctuating body like the inhabitants of the locality cannot claim an easement as can be done in customary easement. Easements are private rights belonging to particular persons while customary rights are public rights annexed to the place in general (Brahma Nand v. Teju Ram, 2019-195 AIC 584).</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Easement and</strong> </span><strong><u>Grant</u></strong> </p>
<p>The term ‘<strong>Grant’ is used </strong>to denote-</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>A generic term to mean ‘transfer’ of immovable property (e.g., sale, lease, gift etc.).</li>
<li>But, in judicial parlance, it will not be an absolute ‘transfer’ of property; and remain as a concession, permission, settlement, grant of easement etc., if it is used in place of ‘transfer’ of property.</li>
<li>Present, aid, help etc., and the act of a settlor of trust, or of donor of a charity.</li>
<li>A technical term to denote conditional-transfer of lands by sovereign especially when it is purposefully used to differentiate from ‘transfer’ of property.</li>
<li>More than a licence (which does not create an estate or interest) and less than an outright and unconditional ‘transfer’ of property (similar to sale,  gift etc.).</li>
</ul>
<p>Characteristics of ‘Grant’</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Usually it denotes a grant by deed.</li>
<li>It can be with or without consideration.</li>
<li>Unless specifically specified, it is creation of an ‘interest’ in property (in case of easement, no interest is created; but only a right of enjoyment). </li>
<li>As long as the conditions are fulfilled, grant is usually irrevocable.</li>
<li>Conditions can also be fixed to limit the period of grant.</li>
<li>Inferior interest, out of an interest retained by the grantor, e.g. the grant of a lease of land by the person holding the freehold. (Collins Dictionary of Law).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><u>‘Grant’ – Salmond on Jurisprudence</u></strong></p>
<p>What is <strong><u>‘grant’</u></strong> is stated in Salmond’s Jurisprudence, 12th Edition, at pages 338-339, under the heading ‘The Classes of Agreements’.  According to Salmond  a <strong>grant</strong>–</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>” is an <strong>agreement</strong>“,</li>
<li>“creates a <strong>right</strong>“</li>
<li>is <strong>NOT</strong> “a right <strong>in Personam</strong> between the parties to it”,</li>
<li>examples – “grants of <span style="text-decoration: underline">leases, easements, charges, patents, franchises, licences and so forth</span>“.</li>
</ul>
<p>Salmond distinguishes ‘grant’ from other legal concepts as under.  </p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“…. A <strong>contract</strong> is an agreement which creates an obligation or a<span style="text-decoration: underline"> right in personam</span> between the parties to it. </li>
<li>A <strong><u>grant</u></strong> is an agreement which creates a right of <span style="text-decoration: underline">any other description</span>; examples being grants of <span style="text-decoration: underline">leases, easements, charges, patents, franchises, licences and so forth</span>. </li>
<li>An agreement which transfers a right may be termed generically an <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">assignment</span>. </strong>On which extinguishes a right is a release, discharge, or surrender.” (Quoted in H. Anraj v. Government of Tamil Nadu  (&amp; Shri Dipak Dhar v. The State of West Bengal), AIR 1986 SC 63: (1986) 1 SCC 414.)</li>
