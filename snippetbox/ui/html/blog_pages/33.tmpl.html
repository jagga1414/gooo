<p><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Introduction</span></p>
<p>Order XXII rule 3 of the Code of Civil Procedure lays down the ‘Procedure in case of death of one of several plaintiffs or of sole plaintiff’; rule 4  speaks as to the ‘Procedure in case of death of one of several defendants or of sole defendant<strong>’ </strong>to implead the<strong> </strong>legal representatives of the deceased defendant.  Order XXII rule 5 of the CPC directs the courts to determine the<strong> </strong>‘Question as to Legal Representative’.</p>
<p><strong><u>Order XXII Rule 3 of the CPC reads as under:</u></strong></p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>3. </strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Procedure in case of death of one of several plaintiffs or of sole plaintiff.</span><strong>(1)</strong> Where one of two or more plaintiffs dies and the right to sue does not survive to the surviving plaintiff or plaintiffs alone, or a sole plaintiff or sole surviving plaintiff dies and the right to the sue survives, the Court, on an application made in that behalf, shall cause the legal representative of the deceased plaintiff to be made a party and shall proceed with the suit.</li>
<li><strong>(2)</strong> Where within the time limited by law no application is made under sub-rule (1), the suit shall abate so far as the deceased plaintiff is concerned, and, on the application of the defendant, the Court may award to him the costs which he may have incurred in defending the suit, to be recovered from the estate of the deceased plaintiff.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><u>Order XXII Rule 4 of the CPC reads as under:</u></strong></p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>4<u>. Procedure in case of death of one of several defendants or of sole defendant</u>.- (1) Where one of the two or more defendants dies and the right to sue does not survive against the surviving defendant or defendants alone, or a sole defendant or sole surviving defendant dies and the right to sue survives, the court, on an application made in that behalf, shall cause the legal representative of the deceased defendant to be made a party and shall proceed with the suit.</li>
<li>(2) Any person so made a party may make any defence appropriate to his character as legal representative of the deceased defendant.</li>
<li>(3) Where within the time limited by law no application is made under sub-rule (1), the suit shall abate as against the deceased defendant.</li>
<li>(4)The court whenever it thinks fit, may exempt the plaintiff from the necessity of substituting the legal representatives of any such defendant who has failed to file a written statement or who, having filed it, has failed to appear and contest the suit at the hearing; and judgment may, in such case, be pronounced against the said defendant notwithstanding the death of such defendant and shall have the same force and effect as if it has been pronounced before death took place.</li>
<li>(5) Where,—
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>(a) the plaintiff was ignorant of the death of a defendant, and could not, for that reason, make an application for the substitution of the legal representative of the defendant under this rule within the period specified in the Limitation Act, 1963 (36 of 1963), and the suit has, in consequence, abated, and</li>
<li>(b) the plaintiff applies after the expiry of the period specified there for in the Limitation Act, 1963 (36 of 1963), for setting aside the abatement and also for the admission of that application under section 5 of that Act on the ground that he had, by reason of such ignorance, sufficient cause for not making the application within the period specified in the said Act,</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>the court shall, in considering the application under the said section 5, have due regard to the fact of such ignorance, if proved.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><u>Order XXII Rule 5 of the CPC reads as under:</u></strong></p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>5. <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Determination of Question as to Legal Representativ</span><span style="text-decoration:underline;">e</span>.  Where a question arises as to whether any person is or is not the legal representative of a deceased plaintiff or a deceased defendant, such question shall be determined by the Court:</li>
<li><strong>Provided</strong> that where such question arises before an Appellate Court, that Court may, before determining the question, direct any subordinate Court to try the question and to return the records together with evidence, if any, recorded at such trial, its findings and reasons therefor, and the Appellate Court <span style="text-decoration:underline;">may</span> take the same into consideration in determining the question.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Injunction Suit and ‘Right to Sue Survives’</span></strong></p>
<p>Observing that there is a distinction between the death of the plaintiff and the death of the defendant, it is held that Venkubai v. Assistant Commissioner, Sedam, Gulbarga District, 1999-1 CivCC 119; 1998-5 KarLJ 171, that the decree of injunction would become infructuous on the death of the (sole) defendant or the party against whom injunction is granted. </p>
<p>In Venkubai v. Assistant Commissioner, Sedam, Gulbarga it was further observed that if the person who got an injunction were to die, certainly his L. Rs would be entitled to the benefit of the decree. (Krishna Behari Goel v. Raj Mangal Persad, AIR 1954 All 182 referred to.)</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Direction in Proviso to <strong><u>Order XXII Rule 5 of the CPC </u></strong> is not Mandatory</span></strong></p>
<p>It is clear from the wordings (Court <strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">MAY</span></strong>) of the ‘Proviso’<strong> </strong> that “direct any subordinate Court to try the question” (where such question<strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;"> arises </span></strong>before an Appellate Court) is <strong>not mandatory</strong>.</p>
<p><strong><u>Proceedings, Summary in Nature</u></strong></p>
<p>The jurisdiction to determine who is a legal heir is summary in nature. Varadarajan v.  Kanakavalli, AIR 2020 SC 740. Such determination will not confer any right to the legal representatives, as regards any other claim, as to the estate of the deceased.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">No Conclusive Decision on Legal heirs or Legal Representatives</span></strong></p>
<p>In Jaladi Suguna v. Satya Sai Central Trust, (2008) 8 SCC 521, our Apex Court held as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“15. Filing an application to bring the legal representatives on record, does not amount to bringing the legal representatives on record. When an LR application is filed, the court should consider it and decide whether the persons named therein as the legal representatives, should be brought on record to represent the estate of the deceased. <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Until such decision by the court, the persons claiming to be the legal representatives have no right to represent</span> the estate of the deceased, nor prosecute or defend the case. If there is a dispute as to who is the legal representative, a decision should be rendered on such dispute. Only when the question of legal representative is determined by the court and such legal representative is brought on record, can it be said that the estate of the deceased is represented. The determination as to who is the legal representative under <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Order 22 Rule 5</span> will of course be for the<span style="text-decoration:underline;"> limited purpose of representation of the estate of the deceased</span>, for adjudication of that case. Such determination for such limited purpose will not confer on the person held to be the legal representative, any right to the property which is the subject-matter of the suit, vis-à-vis other rival claimants to the estate of the deceased.” (Quoted in: Mahanth Satyanand @ Ramjee Singh v. Shyam Lal Chauhan, 2018-18 SCC 485; Varadarajan v.  Kanakavalli , AIR 2020 SC 740)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><u>Proceedings</u></strong> <strong><u>Court Cannot be Postpone</u><span style="text-decoration:underline;">d</span></strong></p>
<p>The court has to decide on merits who are the legal representatives of the deceased for the limited purpose of representation of the estate of the deceased of that case. The court cannot postpone the determination.</p>
<p>The Apex Court (Jaladi Suguna v. Satya Sai Central Trust) continued as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“The provisions of <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Rule 4 and 5 of Order XXII are mandatory</span>. When a respondent in an appeal dies, the court cannot simply say that it will hear all rival claimants to the estate of the deceased respondent and proceed to dispose of the appeal. Nor can it implead all persons claiming to be legal representatives, as parties to the appeal without deciding who will represent the estate of the deceased and proceed to hear the appeal on merits. <span style="text-decoration:underline;">The court cannot also postpone the decision</span> as to who is the legal representative of the deceased respondent, for being decided along with the appeal on merits. The Code clearly provides that where a question arises as to whether any person is or is not the legal representative of a deceased respondent, such question shall be determined by the court.</li>
<li> … … Though Rule 5 does not specifically provide that determination of legal representative should precede the hearing of the appeal on merits, Rule 4 read with Rule 11 makes it clear that the <span style="text-decoration:underline;">appeal can be heard only after the legal representatives are brought on record</span>”. (Quoted in: Mahanth Satyanand @ Ramjee Singh v. Shyam Lal Chauhan, 2018-18 SCC 485)</li>
</ul>
<p>In Daya Ram v. Shyam Sundari, AIR 1965 SC 1049, it was held that the legal representatives are impleaded <span style="text-decoration:underline;">for the purpose of a suit alone</span> and that the impleaded legal representatives sufficiently represent the estate of the deceased and the decision obtained with them on record would bind not merely those impleaded but the entire estate, including those not brought on record (Referred to in Varadarajan v.  Kanakavalli , AIR 2020 SC 740).</p>
<p>In Suresh Kumar Bansal v. Krishna Bansal  (2010) 2 SCC 162 the Supreme Court held as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“20. It is now well settled that determination of the question as to who is the legal representative of the deceased plaintiff or defendant under Order 22 Rule 5 of the Code of Civil Procedure is only <span style="text-decoration:underline;">for the purpose of bringing legal representatives on record for the conducting of those legal proceedings only </span>and does not operate as res judicata and the inter se dispute between the rival legal representatives has to be independently tried and decided in probate proceedings. If this is allowed to be carried on for a decision of an eviction suit or other allied suits, the suits would be delayed, by which only the tenants will be benefited.”</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><u>No Res Judicata</u></strong></p>
<p>The summary decision as to who are the legal representatives of the deceased will not be res judicata and the disputes thereon can be independently tried in other proceedings including probate proceedings (Suresh Kumar Bansal v. Krishna Bansal,  (2010) 2 SCC 162).</p>
<p>Punjab &amp; Haryana High Court in Mohinder Kaur v. Piara Singh, AIR 1981 P&amp;H 130, held that a decision under Order XXII Rule 5 would <strong>not</strong> be res judicata in a subsequent suit. It was held as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“5. So far as the first argument of Mr. Bindra, noticed above is concerned, we find that in addition to the judgments of the Lahore High Court and of this Court, referred to in the earlier part of this judgment, he is supported by a string of judgments of other High Courts as well wherein it has repeatedly been held on varied reasons, that, a decision under Order 22, Rule 5, Civil Procedure Code, would not operate as res judicata in a subsequent suit between the same parties or persons claiming through them wherein the question of succession or heirship to the deceased party in the earlier proceedings is directly raised. Some of these reasons are as follows:—</li>
<li>(i) Such a decision is not on an issue arising in the suit itself, but is really a matter collateral to the suit and has to be decided before the suit itself can be proceeded with. The decision does not lead to the determination of any issue in the suit.</li>
<li>(ii) The legal representative is appointed for orderly conduct of the suit only. Such a decision could not take away, for all times to come, the rights of a rightful heir of the deceased in all matters.</li>
<li>(iii) The decision is the result of a summary enquiry against which no appeal has been provided for.</li>
<li>(iv) The concepts of legal representative and heirship of a deceased party are entirely different.</li>
<li>In order to constitute one as a legal representative, it is unnecessary that he should have a beneficial interest in the estate. The executors and administrators are legal representatives though they may have no beneficial interest. Trespasser into the property of the deceased claiming title in himself independently of the deceased will not be a legal representative. On the other hand the heirs on whom beneficial interest devolved under the law whether statute or other, governing the parties will be legal representatives.” (Quoted in Varadarajan v.  Kanakavalli, AIR 2020 SC 740. See also: Dashrath Rao Kate v. Brij Mohan Srivastava (2010) 1 SCC 277).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><u>Legal Representatives Need Not be the Legal Heirs.</u></strong></p>
<p>A legatee under a will can be a legal representative.  </p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>See: Varadarajan v.  Kanakavalli, AIR 2020 SC 740, </li>
<li>Suresh Kumar Bansal v. Krishna Bansal, (2010) 1 SCC (Civ) 365; </li>
<li>Jaladi Suguna v. Satya Sai Central Trust, (2008) 8 SCC 521.</li>
</ul>
<p>‘Legal representative’ according to its definition in section 2(11) of CPC is a person who in law represents the estate of a deceased person and includes any person who intermeddles (administers or executors) with the estate of the deceased and where a party acts in a representative character, the person on whom the estate devolves on the death of the party so acting.</p>
<p><strong><u>If Many Heirs, those in Possession Entitled to Represent</u></strong></p>
<p>If there are many heirs, those in possession bona fide, without there being any fraud or collusion, are also entitled to represent the estate of the deceased. See. Custodian of Branches of Banco, v. Nalini Bai Naique, AIR 1989 SC 1589.</p>
<p><strong><u>Representation of/by Some Heirs, Binds also who are not brought on record</u></strong></p>
<p>In Daya Ram v.  Shyam Sundari, AIR 1965 SC 1049, the Supreme Court held that if after bona fide inquiry, some, but not all the heirs, of a deceased defendant, are brought on record the heirs so brought on record represent the entire estate of the deceased and the decision of the Court in the absence of fraud or collusion binds even those who are not brought on record as well as those who are impleaded as legal representatives of the deceased defendant.</p>
<p>In NK Mohammad Sulaiman v. NC Mohammad Ismail, AIR 1966 SC 792, the Supreme Court rejected the contention that the auction purchaser obtained title only to the extent of the interest of the heirs who were impleaded eo nominee; and held that</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>(i) those who were impleaded, <span style="text-decoration:underline;">may ‘sufficiently represent’</span> the entire estate and all heirs,</li>
<li>(ii) the rule enunciated was of the <span style="text-decoration:underline;">domain of procedural law</span> and applied to all communities <span style="text-decoration:underline;">irrespective of the religious persuasion</span> or personal law and</li>
<li>(iii) where after due enquiry certain persons were impleaded after diligent and <span style="text-decoration:underline;">bona fide enquiry</span> in the genuine belief that they were the only persons interested in the estate, the whole estate of the deceased <span style="text-decoration:underline;">would be duly represented by the persons who were brought on the record</span> or impleaded, and the decree would be binding upon the entire estate.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><u>Execution of a Decree – No abatement</u></strong></p>
<p>Order 22 Rule 12 reads as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“Application of order to proceedings. Nothing in Rules 3, 4 and 8 shall apply to proceedings in execution of a decree or order.”</li>
</ul>
<p>V. Uthirapathi v. Ashrab, (1998) 3 SCC 148, it is held that abatement does not apply to execution proceedings. It is held as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“12. In other words, the normal principle arising in a suit — before the decree is passed — that the legal representatives are to be brought on record within a particular period and if not, the suit could abate, — is not applicable to cases of death of the decree-holder or the judgment-debtor in execution proceedings.</li>
<li>13. In Venkatachalam Chetti v. Ramaswami Servai [ILR (1932) 55 Mad 352 : AIR 1932 Mad 73 (FB)] a Full Bench of the Madras High Court has held that this rule enacts that the penalty of abatement shall not attach to execution proceedings.</li>
<li>Mulla’s Commentary on CPC [(Vol. 3) p. 2085 (15th Edn., 1997)] refers to a large number of judgments of the High Courts and says:
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“Rule 12 engrafts an exemption which provides that where a party to an execution proceedings dies during its pendency, provisions as to abatement do not apply. The Rule is, therefore, for the benefit of the decree-holder, for his heirs need not take steps for substitution under Rule 2 but may apply immediately or at any time while the proceeding is pending, to carry on the proceeding or they may file a fresh execution application.”</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>14. In our opinion, the above statement of law in Mulla’s Commentary on CPC, correctly represents the legal position relating to the procedure to be adopted by the parties in execution proceedings and as to the powers of the civil court.” (Quoted in: Varadarajan v.  Kanakavalli, AIR 2020 SC 740).</li>
