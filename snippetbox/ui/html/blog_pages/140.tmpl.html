<p>Section 27 of the Evidence Act reads-</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“27. <span style="text-decoration: underline">How much of information received from accused may be proved</span>.

<p><strong><u>Section 27 is Not Artistically Worded</u></strong></p>
<p>The Privy Council, in Pulukuri Kotayya v. King ­Emperor, AIR 1947 PC 67, the ‘Best Known and Most Authoritative Decision’ in this subject, as shown below, observed that the Section 27 was not artistically worded. It is because of the hardheadedness of the following words in this Section, and they raise the following questions: </p>

<ul class="wp-block-list">

<p>Sec. 27 says that “<em>any fact is deposed to as discovered in consequence of information received from a person accused of any offence, in the custody of a police officer</em>“. Going by the section, the following are not a necessary components to bring-in Sec. 27-</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>‘recovery’,</li>
<li>‘concealment’ and</li>
<li>‘information from an “accused who faces trial”.</li>
</ul>
<p>No doubt, true, Sec. 27 is laid down as an exemption to Sec. 25 and 26, which states as to ‘confession to police’; and Sec. 27  says as to “how much of information received from accused may be proved”. Still, from the words employed in Sec. 27, it is definite that this section will be attracted even if <em>the “person accused of</em>“<em> the offence</em> is (i) found innocent and set-free without being charge sheeted in that case and (ii) he “deposed” the “fact” while he was in custody in another case. </p>
<p>It must also be taken note of the fact that the leading section of Chapter II of the Evidence Act (wherein Sec. 27 falls), viz., Sec. 5, lays down as to matters on which ‘evidence may be given’. Merely because evidence under Sec. 27 is relevant, it could not be taken as ‘binding’. The probative value thereof will be a matter for the court to determine. In State of Bihar v. Radha Krishna Singh, AIR 1983 SC 684, it is observed as regards admissibility of document as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“Admissibility of a document is one thing and its probative value quite another—these two aspects cannot be combined. A document may be admissible and yet may not carry any conviction and weight or its probative value may be nil.”</li>
</ul>
<p>Sec. 5 Evidence Act reads as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“<span style="text-decoration: underline">Evidence may be given of facts in issue and relevant facts</span>. Evidence may be given in any suit or proceeding of the existence or non-existence of every fact in issue and of such other facts as are hereinafter declared to be relevant, and of no others.”</li>
</ul>
<p>From Pulukuri Kotayya v. King Emperor, AIR 1947 PC 67, it is clear that the words, </p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“the fact discovered embraces the<strong> <mark class="has-inline-color has-primary-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">place</mark></strong> <strong>from which the <mark class="has-inline-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#4137f1"><span style="text-decoration: underline">object is </span></mark><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong><mark><mark class="has-inline-color has-primary-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">produced</mark></mark></strong></span></strong>”  (as used in Pulukuri Kotayya v.

<p><strong><u>Sec. 27 is an Exception to Sec. 25 and 26</u></strong></p>
<p>Sec. 27 is an exception to the two preceding sections, Sec. 25 and 26. They are as to-</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>No confession made to a Police officer shall be proved as against a person accused of any offence (Sec. 25).</li>
<li>No confession made by any person whilst he is in the custody of a Police officer, unless it be made in the immediate presence of a Magistrate, shall be proved as against such person (Sec. 26).</li>

<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>No statement made by any person to a police-officer in the course of an investigation be used for any purpose at any inquiry or trial (except for contradiction under Sec. 145 Evd. Act).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><u>If “place” already known, and not exclusively in knowledge of Accused, No Sec. 27 Recovery</u></strong></p>
<p>It is trite law, as shown in recent decisions of our Apex Court,  <strong>Subramanya v. State of Karnataka</strong>, AIR 2022 SC 5110,  and <strong>Boby v. State of Kerala</strong>, 2023-1 Ker LT 543,  that Sec. 27 would not be attracted if the recovery was from a place which was already known and not exclusively within the knowledge of accused.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">“Any object can be ‘concealed’ in places which are open or accessible to others”</span></strong></p>
<p>In State of Himachal Pradesh v. Jeet Singh, AIR 1999 SC 1293, it is pointed out that it may be possible to hide articles in a place ‘open or accessible to others’. It is said,  “For Example, if the article is <span style="text-decoration: underline">buried on the main roadside</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline">or</span> if it is<span style="text-decoration: underline"> concealed beneath dry leaves</span> lying on public places or kept hidden in a public office, the article would remain out of the visibility of others in normal circumstances.”  (Quoted in- Ibrahim Musa Chauhan v. State of Maharashtra, 2013-13 SCC 689; Lochan Shrivas v. State of Chhattisgarh, AIR 2022 SC 252.)</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">Credibility of the Investigating Officer,  Important</span></strong></p>
<p>But, in several cases it is emphasised that the credibility of the evidence of the investigating officer was really important (See- Mohd. Arif @ Ashfaq v. State (NCT) of Delhi, (2011) 13 SCC 621, Himachal Pradesh Administration v. Om Prakash, AIR 1972 SC 975.)</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">Failure to Record Information of the Accused, Not Fatal</span></strong></p>
<p>It was pointed out in Suresh Chandra Bahri v. State of Bihar, AIR 1994 SC 2420, that failure to record the information given by the accused and failure to examine public witnesses, are not fatal to the prosecution.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Exact Statement</strong></span><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong> of the Accused must be deposed by the Police Officer</strong></span></p>
<p>Courts in India insists (unduly?) that <span style="text-decoration: underline">the exact disclosure statement</span> of the accused should be stated by the police officer, in the “Recovery Mahazar” and before the court.   In Subramanya v. State of Karnataka, AIR 2022 SC 5110, it is observed as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“<strong>83. </strong>The first and the basic infirmity in the evidence of all the aforesaid prosecution witnesses is that <span style="text-decoration: underline">none of them have deposed the exact statement said to have been made by the appellant herein which ultimately led to the discovery of a fact</span> relevant under Section 27 of the Evidence Act.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">Disclosure Statement under Sec. 27 Need Not be in Presence of Witnesses</span></strong></p>
<p>In Praveen Kumar v. State of Karnataka, (2003) 12 SCC 199, our Apex Court held that <span style="text-decoration: underline">Section 27 does <strong>not</strong> lay down</span> that the statement made to a Police Officer <span style="text-decoration: underline">should always be in the presence of independent witnesses</span>.  It reads-</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“21. Section 27 does not lay down that the statement made to a Police Officer should always be in the presence of independent witnesses. Normally in cases where the evidence led by the prosecution as to a fact depends solely on the Police witnesses, the courts seek corroboration as a matter of caution and not as a matter of rule. Thus it is <span style="text-decoration: underline">only a rule of prudence which makes the court to seek corroboration from independent source</span>, in such cases while assessing the evidence of Police. But in cases where the court is satisfied that the evidence of the Police can be independently relied upon then in such cases there is no prohibition in law that the same cannot be accepted without independent corroboration. In the instant case nothing is brought on record to show why evidence of PW-33 I.O. should be disbelieved in regard to the statement made by the accused as per Ex. P-35. Therefore, the argument that statement of the appellant as per Ex.P-35 should be rejected because the same is not made in the presence of independent witness has to be rejected.”</li>

</ul>
<p>In Nisar Khan @ Guddu v. State of Uttaranchal, (2006) 9 SCC 386, it was held that the discovery statement and the recovery memo need not bear the signature of the accused.</p>

<p>Subramanya v. State of Karnataka, AIR 2022 SC 5110, reads as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>84. </strong>If, it is say of the investigating officer that the accused appellant while in custody on his own free will and volition made a statement that he would lead to the place where he had hidden the weapon of offence, the site of burial of the dead body, clothes etc., then the first thing that the investigating officer should have done was to call for two independent witnesses at the police station itself. Once the two independent witnesses would arrive at the police station thereafter in their presence the accused should be asked to make an appropriate statement as he may desire in regard to pointing out the place where he is said to have hidden the weapon of offence etc. <span style="text-decoration: underline">When the accused while in custody makes such statement before the</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline">two independent witnesses (panch­-witnesses) the exact statement or rather the exact words uttered by the accused should be incorporated in the first part of the panchnama that the investigating officer may draw in accordance with law.</span> This first part of the panchnama for the purpose of Section 27 of the Evidence Act is always drawn at the police station in the presence of the independent witnesses so as to lend credence that a particular statement was made by the accused expressing his willingness on his own free will and volition to point out the place where the weapon of offence or any other article used in the commission of the offence had been hidden. Once the first part of the panchnama is completed thereafter the police party along with the accused and the two independent witnesses (panch­ witnesses) would proceed to the particular place as may be led by the accused. If from that particular place anything like the weapon of offence or blood stained clothes or any other article is discovered then that part of the entire process would form the second part of the panchnama. This is how the law expects the investigating officer to draw the discovery panchnama as contemplated under Section 27 of the Evidence Act. If we read the entire oral evidence of the investigating officer then it is clear that the same is deficient in all the aforesaid relevant aspects of the matter.” (It is quoted and followed by the Apex Court in <strong>Boby v. State of Kerala</strong>, 2023-1 Ker LT 543).
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li class="has-xs-font-size"><span style="text-decoration: underline">Note</span>: In Praveen Kumar v. State of Karnataka, (2003) 12 SCC 199, our Apex Court held that Section 27 <strong>does not </strong>lay down that the statement made to a Police Officer should <strong>always be <span style="text-decoration: underline">in the presence of independent witnesses</span></strong>. </li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In any case, the observation in Subramanya v. State of Karnataka, AIR 2022 SC 5110 – ‘when the accused while in custody makes such statement before the <span style="text-decoration: underline">two independent witnesses (panch-­witnesses)</span>’, is only obiter; in view of the earlier observation in the judgment, which reads as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“The first and the basic infirmity in the evidence of all the aforesaid prosecution witnesses is that none of them have deposed the exact statement said to have been made by the appellant herein which ultimately led to the discovery of a fact relevant under Section 27 of the Evidence Act.”</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec. 27 is a Most Misused Provision</span></strong></p>
<p>Sec. 27 is an effective instrumentality to prove the truth in criminal cases before the courts, though it is inappropriately <span style="text-decoration: underline">said by some</span> persons that it is the most misused provision. No doubt, the critics are undeniably wrong; for, it is not a great Indian hypocrisy in criminal-investigation. All who handle matters in Court and Police know the truth. </p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline">Law Commission of India</span></p>
<p>But, the Law Commission of India has qualified it as a ‘malady’ and recommended in its 152<sup>nd</sup> Report (Report On Custodial Crimes), dated 26-8-1994, as under: </p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“If information spoken of in section 27 is not forthcoming voluntarily, the <span style="text-decoration: underline">police may have recourse to procuring the same by other means</span>. This is not to say that in every case the information is compelled to be given. But it cannot be gainsaid that the very existence of the section (in the form in which it appears at present in the Act) creates an impression or an urge to resort to means not desirable or legitimate so that the section is pressed into service in situations never intended by the legislature. <span style="text-decoration: underline">We are convinced that the section needs an amendment</span>, <span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>if not repeal</strong></span>, in order to completely ward off the tendency mentioned above.</li>
<li>In order to meet the malady two courses are open. Section 27 may be <span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>repealed in toto</strong></span> and that is our first reference. But if that course is not acceptable, the minimum that can be done is to revise the section so as to confine it to make admissible the fact discovered but not the information. Therefore, if the milder alternative of merely amending Section 27 (<strong>and not its total repeal</strong>) is to be adopted, we would recommend that Section-27 may be replaced by the following Section-
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>’27. <span style="text-decoration: underline">Discovery of facts at the instance of the accused</span>– When any relevant fact is deposed to as discovered in consequence of information received from a person accused of any offence, whether or not such person is in the custody of a police officer, the fact discovered may be proved, but not the information, whether it amounts to a confession or not’.”</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline">Supreme Court of India</span></p>
<p>In Geejaganda Somaiah v. State of Karnataka, AIR 2007 SC 1355, our Supreme Court said as follows:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“As the section is <span style="text-decoration: underline">alleged to be</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline">frequently <strong>misused by the police</strong></span>, the courts are required to be vigilant about its application. The court must ensure the credibility of evidence by police because this provision is vulnerable to abuse.” </li>
<li>It is quoted in-
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Jafarudheen v. State of Kerala, AIR 2022 SC 3627; </li>
<li>Mukesh v. State of Delhi,  (Nirbhaya Case) 2017-6 SCC 1; </li>

</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline">Conclusion</span></p>
<p>Law must be specific and accurate. Otherwise, those who enforce it may be free to handle it according to their understanding, if not speculation.</p>
<p>It is really disgraceful to continue Section 27 of the Evidence Act,  in its present tough-and-rough form, without change, in spite of the observation of the Privy Council, in Pulukuri Kotayya v. King ­Emperor as early as in 1947, that it was <span style="text-decoration: underline">not artistically worded</span>; and after the resounding recommendation  of the Law Commission of India  that Section-27 should <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">be repealed in toto</span></strong>. </p>
