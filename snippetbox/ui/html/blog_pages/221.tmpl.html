<p><strong>“<u>Implied Grant” – Two Different Legal Attributions in Law of Easements </u></strong></p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>First, </strong> <strong><u>Theoretical basis of easement of necessity</u> </strong>(and quasi easement). Both easement of necessity and quasi easement are dealt with in Sec. 13 Easements Act. Theoretically both these rights arise from implied approval of the servient owner; and therefore it is said to be “implied grant”. Though both easement of necessity and quasi easement have some common features, both are distinguishable and cannot go together.</li>
<li><strong>Second, ‘<u>Easement by grant’ that arises by implication</u></strong>. Grant of easement may be express or implied (that is arisen by necessary implication). An ‘implied grant’ is also governed under Sec. 8 of the Easement Act which deals with express grant. Easement by implied grant is not a right akin to ‘quasi easement’ (in Sec. 13 of the Easement Act). Implied grant is controlled by the (implied) terms and conditions of the grant; and an implied grant of way also will not be defeated by the emergence of an alternative way.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>“<u>Implied Grant” has as much efficacy as an Express Grant</u></strong></p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li> In Hero Vinoth v.  Seshammal, 2006-5 SCC 545, it is laid down that the <strong><mark class="has-inline-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#3c21f7">grant </mark></strong>may be express or implied. </li>
<li>In Kuppakkal v. Mathan Chettiar, AIR 1924 Mad 834, Annapurna  v. Santosh Kumar, AIR 1937 Cal 661; Ratanchand Chordia v. Kasim Khaleeli, AIR 1964 Mad 209 and  L. Govindarajulu Chettiar v. V. N. Srinivasalu Naidu, AIR  1972 Mad 307, it was held that the <strong><mark class="has-inline-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#3c21f7">grant </mark></strong>of a right of way which had necessarily to be implied on a true construction of the deed, had <strong>as much efficacy as an express</strong> <strong><mark class="has-inline-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#3c21f7">grant</mark></strong>.</li>
<li>It was held in R. Sivanandan v. Rajammal, (1975) 1 Mad LJ 251, that the implied grant could be raised even if there was no express  <strong><mark class="has-inline-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#3c21f7">grant</mark></strong>; and that the argument that the <strong><u>absence of an express grant</u></strong> would negative an implied grant was quite untenable.</li>
<li>Easement right by way of implied <strong><mark class="has-inline-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#3c21f7">grant </mark></strong>stated in Sree Swayam Prakash Ashramam v. G. Anandavally Amma, AIR 2010 SC 622, is this ‘Easement by <strong><mark class="has-inline-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#3c21f7">grant</mark></strong>’ that arise by implication.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><u>Methods of Acquisition of Easements</u></strong></p>
<p>The Indian Easements Act, 1882 refers to the different methods by which easements are acquired. They are pointed out (<strong>Ramkanya Bai v. Jagdish</strong>, AIR 2011 SC 3258) to be the following:</p>
<ol class="wp-block-list" start="1" style="list-style-type:1">
<li>easements by grant: <strong>express</strong> <strong><mark class="has-inline-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#3c21f7">grant </mark></strong>by the owner of the servient heritage</li>
<li>easements of necessity: based on <strong>implied  <strong><mark class="has-inline-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#3c21f7">grants</mark></strong></strong> or reservations made by the owner of a servient heritage at the time of transfers or partitions</li>
<li>easements by prescription: that it is <strong>presumed</strong> to be acquired by peaceable and open enjoyment, without interruption for twenty years and</li>
<li>customary easements: it is <strong>inferred</strong> to be acquired by virtue of a local custom.</li>
</ol>
<p>For easement by prescription, it is not necessary that the user should be exclusive, but the claimant should exercise it under some claim existing in his own favour independently of all others.</p>
<p><strong>“<u>Basis of Every Right of Easement Is, Theoretically, a  <strong><mark class="has-inline-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#3c21f7">grant</mark></strong>”</u></strong></p>
<p>The origin of all easements is, theoretically, <strong><mark class="has-inline-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#3c21f7">grant </mark></strong>by the servient owner. It may be express or implied. It may also be presumed from long user. It is observed in <strong>Sree Swayam Prakash Ashramam v. G. Anandavally Amma</strong>, AIR 2010 SC 622, as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“Theoretically all easements have their origin in some sort of <strong><mark class="has-inline-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#3c21f7">grant </mark></strong>by the servient owner. The <strong><mark class="has-inline-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#3c21f7">grant </mark></strong>may be express or it may be implied from the surrounding attendant circumstances and conduct of the parties or it may even be presumed from long user. In the case of an express <strong><mark class="has-inline-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#3c21f7">grant </mark></strong>of easement the limit thereof depends on the words used.”</li>
</ul>
<p>In Lachhi v. Ghansara Singh, AIR 1972 HP 89, it is held as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“The basis of every right of easement by whatsoever method it may have been acquired, is theoretically a <strong><mark class="has-inline-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#3c21f7">grant </mark></strong>from the servient-owner.
<ul class="wp-block-list">

<li>Quasi Easements arise usually on partition or bequeath (under a Will). It pertains to Apparent and Continuous rights. Sec. 5 of the Easements Act defines apparent and continuous easements.

<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">Easement by prescription </span></strong>is acquired by hostile and notorious acts; but user of it should be peaceable and open enjoyment, without interruption for twenty years. Therefore <strong>grant is presumed</strong> in easement by prescription. </p>
<p>Origin of <span style="text-decoration: underline">Easements of necessity</span> and <span style="text-decoration: underline">Easement by prescription</span> are different (<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">Easements of necessity</span></strong> is based on <strong>implied grants</strong>.  It is based on some sort of ‘consent, approval or permission’; but, <span style="text-decoration: underline">Easement by Prescription</span> is arisen from prescriptive or hostile acts). Hence, both these rights are  <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">antithetical to each other</span></strong>. In Natesa Gounder v. Raja Gounder, 2012-5 Mad LW 649, it is observed as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“Implied <strong><mark class="has-inline-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#3c21f7">grant </mark></strong>and the concept easement by prescription are quite <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">antithetical to each other</span></strong>. If a person is having an implied <strong><mark class="has-inline-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#3c21f7">grant</mark></strong> in his favour, then the question of prescription would not arise.” (Quoted in: Kalyan Spinning Mills v. M.  Chellappan, AIR  2023 Mad 8, P.  Sadayan v. Arumugam, 2020-1 Mad LW 535)</li>
<li>See also: Joy Joseph v. Jose Jacob, 2010 (4) KHC 167; Kochu Nadar v. Kunjan Nadar Gabriel,2011 SCC OnLine Ker 2674;  Kallen Devi v. Kizhakkekoroth Raghavan, 2012 (3) KLT 142; Kamala Devi Amma v. Rajan, 2017 (4) KLJ 700;  Lilly v. Wilson, 2018 (1) KLT 772. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong><u>Easement is Acquired; Not Arise out of ‘Express Permission’</u></strong></p>
<p>Sec. 12, Easements Act states that an easement is acquired by the owner of an immovable property. It is observed by the Apex Court in <strong>Bachhaj Nahar Vs. Nilima Mandal</strong>, AIR 2009 SC 1103, that the claimant of easement (prescription) should plead and prove that the right claimed was enjoyed independent of any agreement with the owner of the property over which the right is claimed, as any user with the express permission of the owner will be a licence and not an easement. </p>
<p><strong><u>Easement-by-Prescription</u></strong> <strong><u>– “Grant” or Acquisition by “Hostile or Notorious Act”? Is there incongruity?</u></strong> </p>
<p>The basis of every right of easement is theoretically a <strong><mark class="has-inline-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#3c21f7">grant </mark></strong>from the servient-owner. Grant is <strong>presumed</strong> in easement by prescription, for long and continued user. Is there incongruity (in case of easement by prescription) in saying that it is ‘<strong><mark class="has-inline-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#3c21f7">grant</mark></strong>’ (on one part) and ‘acquisition by prescription’ which suggests ‘adverse’ and ‘hostile or notorious’ user (on the other part)?</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>The answer is that the ‘<span style="text-decoration: underline">grant</span>’ herein is only a “<strong>presumption in law</strong>”; and virtually, easement by prescription has to be acquired by hostile and/or notorious acts.</li>
<li>It is clear from Sec. 12 and 15 of the Easement Act.</li>
</ul>
<p>Tanba Nusaji Mahajan v. Pandhari Mahajan, 2004 (6) BomCR 782, 2004 (4) MhLJ 109 lays down the legal position accepted by Indian law, clearly, as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“The acquisition of way by <strong><u>adverse</u></strong> user is based upon the theory of the <strong><u>hostility</u></strong> of the use to the title of the person over whose lands it is <strong>acquired,</strong> while a way of necessity is based upon an implication of an intended <strong><mark class="has-inline-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#3c21f7">grant </mark></strong>and the use of it is based entirely upon such implication or consent to its use.”</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">Easement by Prescription is ‘Acquired’ by ‘Prescriptive’ user.</span></strong></p>
<p>Chapsibhai Dhanjibhai Danad vs Purushotram, 1971 AIR 1878, it was pointed out as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“In Ravachand v. Maniklal (ILR 1946 Bom. 184), it was held that an easement by prescription under ss. 12 and 15 of the Act is in fact an assertion of a <strong>hostile claim</strong> of certain rights over another man’s property and in order to acquire the easement the person who asserts the hostile claim must prove that he had the consciousness to exercise that <strong>hostile claim </strong>on a property which is not his own and where no such consciousness is proved he cannot establish a prescriptive acquisition of the fight.”</li>
</ul>
<p>In Raychand Vanmalidas vs Maneklal Mansukhbhai, (1946) 48 BomLR 25 it was held as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“In any case it must be shown that the right was enjoyed as an easement, that is, as an assertion of a <strong>hostile claim</strong> of certain limited rights over somebody else’s property. Such an assertion cannot be held proved without satisfactory proof of the requisite consciousness. Prescriptive easement, as opposed to easement by <strong><mark class="has-inline-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#3c21f7"> <strong><mark class="has-inline-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#3c21f7">grant</mark></strong></mark></strong>, is <strong>always hostile</strong>. It is in fact an assertion of a <strong>hostile claim</strong> of certain rights over another man’s property and as such it resembles in some respects the claim to ownership by adverse possession of property; both are of <strong>hostile origin</strong> and are, therefore, prescriptive rights obtained by adverse enjoyment for a certain period, the difference being that while in the case of adverse possession the possessor must assert his own ownership, in the case of easement he must assert limited rights of user on a property and acknowledge its ownership in some one else. It must, therefore, follow, in my opinion, that a person who asserts such a <strong>hostile claim</strong> must prove that he had the consciousness of exercising that <strong>hostile claim</strong> on a property which is not his own, and where no such consciousness is proved, he cannot prove the prescriptive acquisition of the right”.</li>
</ul>
<p>Easement by prescription is ‘acquired’ by ‘prescriptive’ user. It should not have been by permission or agreement. In case of easement, law requires pleading and proof – that the right claimed was enjoyed independent of any express permission (Bachhaj Nahar Vs. Nilima Mandal, AIR 2009 SC 1103).</p>
<p>It is held in Sree Swayam Prakash Ashramam v. G. Anandavally Amma, AIR 2010 SC 62 that the acquisition of easement by prescription may be classified under the head of implied <strong><mark class="has-inline-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#3c21f7">grant</mark></strong>; for, all prescription presupposes a <strong><mark class="has-inline-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#3c21f7">grant</mark></strong>.</p>
<p><strong><u>Will Easement of Necessity Ripen into a Prescriptive Easement?</u></strong></p>
<p>In other words-</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Can one claim ‘easement of necessity’ and ‘easement by prescription’ with respect to a (same) way, or  </li>
<li>Does a way  that started with minimum width (say a foot-path) under the claim ‘easement of necessity’, and continued, in the course of time, with a higher width (so that cars can be taken) for more than 20 years, yield or bring-in ‘easement by prescription’?</li>
</ul>
<p>We find answer in negative form in Tanba Nusaji Mahajan v, Pandhari Mahajan, 2004 (6) BomCR 782, 2004 (4) MhLJ 109. It is held as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“10. However, a way of necessity is distinguished from the right of way acquired by prescription and <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">cannot ripen into a prescriptive easement so long as the necessity continues</span></strong>. A way of necessity arises by virtue of conditions entirely different from easement of way created by prescription. The former arises by implication of law out of the necessities of the case and is based upon principle of law which negative the existence of a way by continuous adverse user. The <span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>acquisition of way by adverse user is based upon the theory of the hostility</strong></span> of the use to the title of the person over whose lands it is acquired, while a <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">way of necessity is based upon an implication of an intended</span></strong> <strong><mark class="has-inline-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#3c21f7">grant </mark></strong>and the use of it is based entirely upon such implication or consent to its use.”</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Can <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">Easement of Necessity and</span></strong> (Implied) Grant be Claimed Alternatively?</strong></span></p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>It is held in <strong>Sree Swayam Prakash Ashramam v. G. Anandavally Amma</strong>, AIR 2010 SC 622, Easement of Implied Grant can be granted in a suit even though “Grant” alone was Claimed (Alternatively to easement of necessity). Facts of the case, in a nutshell, are the following –</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Plaintiff, owner of A-schedule property (dominant tenement), claimed “<strong><u>easement of necessity or of grant</u></strong>” in B-schedule property (servient tenement).</li>
<li><strong>“Implied grant” </strong>was not specifically pleaded (only ‘grant’ was pleaded).</li>
<li>Dominant tenement had been separated from the servient tenement.</li>
<li>Plaintiff has been using the way in B-schedule property for a long period (about 50 years).</li>
<li>The trial court observed that the plaintiff claiming easement by <strong><mark class="has-inline-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#3c21f7">grant </mark></strong>or easement of necessity has only <strong><u>a primary burden</u></strong> to prove the absence of any alternate pathway (these findings were accepted by the Apex Court).</li>
<li>Defendant alleged that two alternate pathways existed. But, No evidence of any other way to A-schedule property (dominant tenement).</li>
<li>The High Court found that there was <strong><u>implied grant</u></strong> of ‘B’ schedule property as pathway.</li>
</ul>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>The Supreme Court upheld the view of the High Court and the Trial Court and held as under:</li>
<li>“… the High Court was also fully justified in holding that there was <strong>implied grant</strong> of ‘B’ schedule property as pathway, which can be inferred from the circumstances for the reason that
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>(i) no other pathway was provided for access to ‘A’ schedule property of the plaint and</li>
<li>(ii) there was no objection also to the use of ‘B’ schedule property …”</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>It is observed in <strong>Sree Swayam Prakash Ashramam v. G. Anandavally Amma</strong>, AIR 2010 SC 622, as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“17. The High Court limited itself to the issue whether the decree of the first appellate court granting the original plaintiff (since deceased) right of easement over ‘B’ schedule property by way of grant concurring with the findings of the trial court was sustainable.</li>
<li>18. Before the High Court, the defendants pleaded that there had been no appeal or cross objection filed by the original plaintiff (since deceased) against the order of the Appellate Court which disallowed the claim of easement of necessity and, therefore, the finding that there existed no easement of necessity in favour of the original plaintiff (since deceased) over the ‘B’ schedule property stood confirmed. Further they contended that the alternative pathway on the western side of the ‘A’ schedule property was rendered inconvenient by the very act of the original plaintiff (since deceased) who sold that portion of the property to a third party who began digging that pathway resulting in the difference in level. The High Court, on consideration of these contentions, held that though the claim of right of easement by way of necessity over ‘B’ Schedule property may be affected by the subsequent sale of the said plot by the plaintiff in 1983, the claim of right of easement by way of grant over ‘B’ schedule property stood unaffected by the said conduct.</li>
<li>21. The High Court relied on a number of observations in Katiyar’s Law of Easement and Licences (12th Edition) on law with respect to “implication of grant of an easement.” It may arise upon severance of a tenement by its owner into parts. The acquisition of easement by prescription may be classified under the head of implied grant for all prescription presupposes a grant. All that is necessary to create the easement is a manifestation or an unequivocal intention on the part of the servient owner to that effect.</li>
<li>23. Applying these observations to the facts of the case, <strong><u>the High Court held</u> </strong>that though the original grant was by Yogini Amma that grant could not perfect as an easement for the reason that Yogini Amma herself was the owner of both ‘A’ schedule and ‘B’ schedule properties and consequently there was no question of ‘B’ schedule property becoming the servient tenement and ‘A’ schedule property becoming the dominant tenement. However, it was the desire of Yogini Amma that was implemented by her disciples by virtue of the settlement deed. Therefore, the right of the plaintiff to have ‘B’ schedule property as a pathway could not have been taken away by the very same deed. In fact, there was implied grant of ‘B’ schedule property as pathway as can be inferred from the circumstances, namely,
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>i) no other pathway was provided for access to ‘A’ schedule property in the settlement deed and</li>
<li>ii) there was no objection to the use of ‘B’ schedule as pathway.</li>
</ul>

<li>25. We have heard Mr. T.L. Viswanatha Iyer, learned senior counsel for the appellants and Mr. Subramanium Prasad, learned senior counsel for the respondents. We have carefully examined the impugned judgment of the courts below and also the pleadings, evidence and the materials already on record. It is not in dispute that the trial court as well as the First Appellate Court concurrently found on a proper appreciation of the evidence adduced in the case that the ‘B’ Schedule Property of the plaint was being used by the original plaintiff (since deceased) and thereafter, by the respondents even after construction of the building in 1940 in ‘A’ Schedule property of the plaint. The appellants also did not dispute the case of the original plaintiff (since deceased) that he was in continuous occupation of the building even after its construction in the year 1940. It is also not in dispute that the appellants were not able to establish that the original plaintiff (since deceased) was using any other pathway for access to ‘A’ Schedule Property of the plaint and the building therein, which was in the occupation of the original plaintiff (since deceased). The case of the appellants that since there was no mention in the deed of settlement enabling the use of ‘B’ schedule pathway for access to ‘A’ schedule property and the building therein, cannot be the reason to hold that there was no grant as the grant could be by implication as well. It is not in dispute that the fact of the use of the ‘B’ schedule property as pathway even after execution of Exhibit A1, the settlement deed in the year 1982 by the original plaintiff (since deceased) would amply show that there was an implied grant in favour of the original plaintiff (since deceased) relating to ‘B’ schedule property of the plaint for its use as pathway to ‘A’ schedule property of the plaint in residential occupation of the original plaintiff (since deceased). In the absence of any evidence being adduced by the appellants to substantiate their contention that the original plaintiff (since deceased) had an alternative pathway for access to the ‘A’ schedule property, it is difficult to negative the contention of the respondent that since the original plaintiff (since deceased) has been continuously using the said pathway at least from the year 1940 the original plaintiff (since deceased) had acquired an easement right by way of an implied grant in respect of the ‘B’ Schedule property of the plaint. It is an admitted position that both ‘A’ schedule and ‘B’ schedule properties of the plaint belonged to Yogini Amma and her disciples and it was the desire of Yogini Amma that was really implemented by the disciples under the settlement deed executed in favour of the original plaintiff (since deceased). Therefore, the High Court was perfectly justified in holding that when it was the desire of Yogini Amma to Sree Swayam Prakash Ashramam &amp; Anr vs G.Anandavally Amma &amp; Ors grant easement right to the original plaintiff (since deceased) by way of an implied grant, the right of the original plaintiff (since deceased) to have ‘B’ schedule property of the plaint as a pathway could not have been taken away.</li>
<li>In <strong>Annapurna Dutta vs. Santosh Kumar Sett &amp; Ors. [AIR 1937 Cal.661</strong>], B.K. Mukherjee, as His Lordship then was observed:
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“There could be no implied grant where the easements are not continuous and non-apparent. Now a right of way is neither continuous nor always an apparent easement, and hence would not ordinarily come under the rule. Exception is no doubt made in certain cases, where there is a ‘formed road’ existing over one part of the tenement for the apparent use of another portion or there is ‘some permanence in the adaptation of the tenement’ from which continuity may be inferred, but barring these exceptions, an ordinary right of way would not pass on severance unless language is used by the grantor to create a fresh easement.”</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>26. In our view, therefore, the High Court was also fully justified in holding that there was<span style="text-decoration: underline"> </span><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">implied grant of ‘B’ schedule property as pathway</span>,</strong> which can be <span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>inferred from the circumstances</strong></span> for the reason that <strong>no other pathway</strong> was provided for access to ‘A’ schedule property of the plaint and there was <strong>no objection </strong>also to the use of ‘B’ schedule property of the plaint as pathway by the original plaintiff (since deceased) at least up to 1982, when alone the cause of action for the suit arose.”</li>
</ul>
<p>In this decision our Apex Court has also quoted the following from <strong>Katiyar</strong> on Law of Easements and Licences –</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“There are numerous cases in which an agreement to grant easement or some other rights has been inferred or more correctly has been imputed to the person who is in a position to make the grant, on account of some action or inaction on his part. These cases rest on the equitable doctrine of acquiescence, but they may be referred to, for the purpose of classification, as imputed or constructive grants. The party acquiescing is subsequently estopped from denying the existence of easement. It is as if such person had made an actual grant of the easement… … It is the intention of the grantor whether he can be <span style="text-decoration:underline">presumed to have been intended to convey to the grantee a right of easement</span> for the reasonable and convenient enjoyment of the property which has to be ascertained in all the circumstances of the case to find out whether a grant can be implied. A description in a conveyance may connote an intention to create a right of easement. <span style="text-decoration: underline">An <strong>easement may arise by implication</strong>, if the intention to grant can properly be <strong>inferred</strong> either<strong> from</strong> the terms of the grant or the <strong>circumstances</strong></span>“.<strong> </strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong><u>Implied Grant and Quasi Easement in a ‘Formed’ Way</u></strong></p>
<p>There could be no implied grant where the easements are not continuous and non-apparent. But, in Sree Swayam Prakash Ashramam v. G. Anandavally Amma, AIR 2010 SC 622, our Apex Court found <strong><u>quasi easement under Section 13(b)</u></strong> of the Indian Easements Act over a way in the following circumstances –</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Though there could be no implied grant where the easements are not continuous and non-apparent, if there is a <strong><u>‘formed road’</u></strong> existing over one part of the tenement for the apparent use of another portion or there is ‘some permanence in the adaptation of the tenement’ from which continuity may be inferred, an exception can be inferred (Annapurna Dutta vs. Santosh Kumar Sett, AIR 1937 Cal.661, B.K. Mukherjee, referred to).</li>
<li>There was <strong>implied grant of ‘B’ schedule property as pathway</strong><strong>,</strong> which can be <strong><u>inferred from the circumstances</u></strong> for the reason that <strong>no other pathway</strong> was provided for access to dominant property and there was <strong>no objection </strong>also to the use of disputed way by the plaintiff.</li>
<li>An <strong>easement may arise by implication</strong>, if the intention to grant can properly be <strong>inferred</strong> either<strong> from</strong> the terms of the grant or the <strong>circumstances</strong>.</li>
<li><strong><u>A trace of the pathway could be presumed</u></strong> <span style="text-decoration: underline">to be in existence </span>from the time when the plaintiff acquired the properties by separation of tenements.</li>
<li>Only access to the property was through disputed pathway.</li>
<li>It was required for the reasonable and convenient use of the plaintiff’s property and that on severance of the tenements, <strong><u>plaintiff can be presumed to have got a right over disputed pathway</u></strong> <strong><u>by an implied grant</u></strong> and also an easement of necessity.</li>
<li>The user was not obstructed for very long time.</li>
<li>There was no reason to disbelieve the plaintiff’s version that disputed way was given as grant for his use as he was a close relative of the former.</li>
<li>There was an <strong><u>apparent and continuous use which was necessary for the enjoyment of the `A’ schedule property</u></strong> <strong><u>within the meaning of Section 13(b)</u></strong> of the Indian Easements Act.</li>
<li>The defendants have not entered the witness box to disprove the evidence led by the plaintiff.</li>
<li>Therefore, the plaintiff was entitled to easement right in respect of the pathway.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><u>Pleaded ‘Grant’; Not, Implied Grant – Apex Court, allowed Implied Grant</u></strong></p>
<p>Though the plaintiff pleaded only ‘Grant’, and not, Implied Grant,  our Apex Court,  in Sree Swayam Prakash Ashramam v. G. Anandavally Amma, AIR 2010 SC 622, allowed Implied Grant observing as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“It is true that the defendant/appellant alleged that no implied grant was pleaded in the plaint. The Trial Court, in our view, was justified in holding that such pleadings were not necessary when it did not make a difference to the finding arrived at with respect to the easement by way of grant. Accordingly, there is no substance in the argument raised by the learned senior counsel for the appellants.”</li>
