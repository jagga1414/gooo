</ul>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">‘Onus Probandi’ and Sec. 106 of the Evidence Act</span></strong></p>
<p>The Latin maxim, Onus Probandi, means ‘burden of proof’.  This maxim generally conveys the rule and impression that one who asserts a positive fact has to prove it.</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Sec. 101 to 103 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872, deal with the burden of proof in general. Sec. 104 to 106 deal with specific situations.</li>
</ul>
<p>In an election case, referring Sec. 106 and Sec. 114 of the Evidence Act, the Supreme Court, observed in Puneet Rai v. Dinesh Chaudharv, (2003) 8 SCC 204,  that the onus was on the respondent to prove that he belongs to ‘Passi’ community which falls in the Schedule caste category.</p>
<p>In  Sushil Kumar v. Rakesh Kumar, (2003) 8 SCC 673, the Supreme Court found that the burden of proving the age of the elected candidate (above 25 years) was upon him. The Apex Court held as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“28. It is no doubt true that the <span style="text-decoration: underline">burden of proof</span> to show that a candidate who was disqualified as on the date of the nomination would be <span style="text-decoration: underline">on the election petitioner</span>.</li>
<li>29. It is also true that the <span style="text-decoration: underline">initial burden of proof</span>, that nomination paper of an elected candidate has wrongly been accepted, is on the election petitioner.</li>
<li>30. In terms of <span style="text-decoration: underline">Section 103</span> of the Indian Evidence Act, however, the burden of proof as to any particular fact <span style="text-decoration: underline">lies on that person who wishes the Court to believe in its existence</span>, unless it is provided by any law that the proof of that fact shall lie on any particular person.</li>
<li>31. Furthermore, in relation to certain matters, the <span style="text-decoration: underline">fact being within the special knowledge</span> of the respondent, the burden to prove the same <span style="text-decoration: underline">would be on him</span> in terms of <span style="text-decoration: underline">Section 106 </span>of the Indian Evidence Act. However, the question as to whether the burden to prove a particular matter is on the plaintiff or the defendant would depend upon the nature of the dispute.</li>
<li>32. The <span style="text-decoration: underline">age of a person</span>, <span style="text-decoration: underline">in an election petition</span> has to be determined not only on the basis of the materials placed on records but also upon taking into consideration the circumstances attending thereto. The <span style="text-decoration: underline">initial burden</span> to prove the allegations made in the election petition <span style="text-decoration: underline">although was upon the election petitioner</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline">but</span> for proving the <span style="text-decoration: underline">facts</span> which were <span style="text-decoration: underline">within the special knowledge</span> of the respondent, the <span style="text-decoration: underline">burden was upon him</span> in terms of Section 106 of the Evidence Act. </li>
<li>It is also trite that <span style="text-decoration: underline">when both parties have adduced evidence, the question of onus of proof becomes academic</span> [See: Union of India and Others vs. Sugauli Sugar Works (P) Ltd., (1976) 3 SCC 32,(Para 14) and M/s Cox and Kines (Azents) Ltd. vs. Their Workmen and Others, AIR 1977 SC 1666, (Para 36)]. Furthermore, an admission on the part of a party to the lis shall be binding on him and in any event a presumption must be made that the same is taken to be established.”</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">‘Onus Probandi’ and Rule of ‘Best Evidence’</span></strong></p>
<p>Rule of ‘Best Evidence’ requires a party to suit to produce all material evidence with him. If he f<span style="text-decoration: underline">ails to produce the best evidence</span>, then illustration ‘g’ of Section 114 Evidence Act allows the court to take the presumption that, if that evidence had been produced, it would have been unfavourtable to him. In Dharampal v. State of Haryana (P&amp; H, 2020) it is observed as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“20. Chapter VII in Part-Ill of the Evidence Act, 1872 examines the burden of proof and onus of proof or “onus probandi”. <span style="text-decoration: underline">Section 101</span> lays down that whosoever, wants the court to give judgment as to any legal right or liability dependent on the existence of fact, which he asserts, must prove that those facts exist. However, <span style="text-decoration: underline">Section 106 </span>provides that any fact which is essentially within the knowledge of any person, the burden of proving that fact is upon him. Illustration-b to Section 106 specifically provides that if A is charged with travelling on a railway train without ticket, the burden of proving that he had bought a ticket is on the person who was found travelling. Still further, <span style="text-decoration: underline">illustration ‘g’</span> of Section 114 require production of best evidence before the Court/authority. It lays down that the evidence which could be but is not produced, would be deemed to be unfavourable to the person who holds it from the Court/authority. It means that if a person <span style="text-decoration: underline">fails to produce the best evidence </span>which he could produce then the presumption would be that the aforesaid evidence, if had been produced, would be unfavorable to the person, who withholds it.”</li>

<p><mark class="has-inline-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#1c06f7">A Plaintiff has to </mark><span style="text-decoration:underline"><mark class="has-inline-color has-primary-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">win the title-suit</mark></span><mark class="has-inline-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#2c19ed"><span style="text-decoration:underline"> on his evidence</span>; <span style="text-decoration:underline"><strong>not on the weakness</strong></span> of the adversary.</mark> <mark class="has-inline-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#5a09a6">But it must be noted that the plaintiff need to show only a <strong>high degree of probability; </strong>and that it shifts the onus on the defendant.<strong> </strong></mark></p>
<p>This principle applies in both civil and criminal cases. In M. Srinivasulu Reddy v. State Inspector of Police, 1991 (3) ALT 542, 1993 CriLJ 558, it is held as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“The prosecution cannot take advantage of the weaknesses of the defence or cannot take advantage of the inconsistent stand taken by the accused from time to time. The prosecution must stand on its own legs basing on the evidence that has been let in by it.”</li>
</ul>
<p>The Supreme Court of India, in Ratnagiri Nagar Parishad v. Gangaram Narayan Ambekar, (2020) 7 SCC 275, held as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“The <strong>initial burden</strong> of proof is on the plaintiffs to substantiate his cause, if he failed to discharge the same, <strong>the weakness in the defense cannot</strong> be the basis to grant relief to the plaintiffs and burden cannot be shifted on the defendants.”</li>
</ul>
<p>In <strong>R.V.E. Venkatachala Gounder v. Arulmigu Viswesaraswami</strong>, AIR 2003 SC 4548: (2003) 8 SCC 752, the law is stated in the following terms :</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“A fact is said to be ‘proved’ when, if considering the matters before it, the Court either believes it to exist, or considers its existence so probable that a prudent man ought, under the circumstances of a particular case, to act upon the supposition that it exists. It is the evaluation of the result drawn by applicability of the rule, which makes the difference. …”</li>
<li>In a suit for recovery of possession based on title it <span style="text-decoration: underline">is for the plaintiff to prove his title</span> and satisfy the court that he, in law, is entitled to dispossess the defendant from his possession over the suit property and for the possession to be restored to him. However, as held in A. Raghavamma v. A. Chenchamma there is an essential distinction between burden of proof and onus of proof: burden of proof lies upon a person who has to prove the fact and which never shifts. <span style="text-decoration: underline">Onus of proof shifts.</span> Such a shifting of onus is a continuous process in the evaluation of evidence. In our opinion, in a <span style="text-decoration: underline">suit for possession based on title</span> once the <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">plaintiff has been able to create a <mark class="has-inline-color has-primary-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">high degree of probability</mark></span></strong><mark class="has-inline-color has-primary-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><strong> </strong></mark><mark class="has-inline-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#5f0aae">so as to <span style="text-decoration: underline">shift the onus on the defendant</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline">it is for the defendant to discharge his onus</span> and in the absence thereof the burden of proof lying on the plaintiff shall be held to have been discharged so as to amount to proof of the plaintiff’s title</mark><mark class="has-inline-color has-primary-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">.</mark></li>
<li>In the present case, the trial Court and the first appellate Court have noted that the plaintiff has not been able to produce any deed of title directly lending support to his claim for title and at the same time the defendant too has no proof of his title much less even an insignia of title. Being a civil case, the plaintiff cannot be expected to proof his title beyond any reasonable doubt; a high degree of probability lending assurance of the availability of title with him would be enough to shift the onus on the defendant and if the defendant does not succeed in shifting back the onus, the plaintiff’s burden of proof can safely be deemed to have been discharged. In the opinion of the two Courts below, the plaintiff had succeeded in shifting the onus on the defendant and, therefore, the burden of proof which lay on the plaintiff had stood discharged. …”.</li>
<li>The suit property, which is a shop, is situated just adjoining the property owned by the temple. It has come in the evidence that the property which is now owned by the temple was at one time owned by the forefathers of the plaintiff and they made an endowment in favour of the temple. The father of the plaintiff, and then the plaintiff, continued to be the trustees. The trouble erupted when in the late sixties the Charity Commissioner appointed other trustees and Chief Executive Officer of the trust dislodging the plaintiff from trusteeship. The plaintiff staked his claim to trusteeship of the temple submitting that the office of the trustee of the temple was hereditary and belonged to the plaintiff. The plaintiff was managing the trust property as trustee while the property adjoining to the property of the temple, i.e. the suit property, was in possession of the plaintiff as owner occupied by the tenant, the defendant No.2., inducted as such by the father of the plaintiff. At the instance of the Chief Executive Officer of the trust, the defendant No.2, during the continuance of the tenancy in favour of the plaintiff, executed a rent note in favour of the temple attorning the latter as his landlord. This the defendant no.2 could not have done in view of the rule of estoppel as contained in Section 116 of the Evidence Act. It was at the instance of the newly appointed trustees and the Chief Executive Officer who on behalf of the temple started claiming the suit property in occupation of the tenant, defendant No.2, to be trust property belonging to the temple. But for this subsequent development the title of the plaintiff to the suit property would not have been in jeopardy and there would have been no occasion to file the present suit.</li>
<li>The learned counsel for the temple, defendant-respondent No.1, faintly urged that the appellant being a trustee of the temple was trying to misappropriate the property belonging to the temple. For such an insinuation there is neither any averment in the written statement nor any evidence laid. Such a submission made during the course of hearing has been noted by us only to be summarily rejected. We have already held that the appellant is the owner of the suit property entitled to its possession and recovery of arrears of rent from the defendant No.2.</li>
<li>… A high degree of preponderance of probability proving title to the suit property was raised in favour of the appellant and the courts below rightly concluded the burden of proof raised on the plaintiff having been discharged while the onus shifting on the defendant remaining undischarged. ..”</li>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Court is Entitled to Consider the</strong> <strong>Title</strong> <strong>set up by the Defendants also</strong></span></p>
<p>In Ram Chandra Sakharam Mahajan Vs. Damodar Trimbak, AIR 2007 SC 2577, it is observed –</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>In a recovery on title suit, the burden is on the plaintiff to establish title.</li>
<li><mark><strong>Court is also entitled to consider the rival title set up by the defendants</strong>.</mark></li>
<li><strong>Weakness of defence</strong> to establish title, would not enable plaintiff to a decree.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Apex Court held:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“The suit is for <strong>recovery</strong> of possession on the strength of title. Obviously, the <strong>burden is on the plaintiff to establish that title</strong>. No doubt in appreciating the case of title set up by the plaintiff, the <strong>Court is also entitled to consider the rival title set up by the defendants</strong>. But the <strong>weakness of the defence </strong>or the failure of the defendants to establish the title set up by them, <strong>would not enable the plaintiff</strong> to a decree. There cannot be any demur to these propositions.”</li>
<li>“14. We find that the trial Court and the appellate Court were <strong>not justified in refusing the amendment of the plaint</strong> sought for by the plaintiff. No doubt there had been delay in seeking amendment but that delay could have been compensated by awarding costs to the contesting defendants 1 to 9. Therefore, we are satisfied that the amendment sought for by the plaintiff ought to have been allowed. We are inclined to allow the amendment sought for, since it would <strong><u>enable the Court to pin-pointedly consider the real dispute between the parties</u></strong> and would enable it to render a decision more satisfactorily to its conscience. We, therefore, allow the amendment as sought for by the plaintiff at a belated stage. The amendment will be carried out by the plaintiff in the trial Court within three months from this date as per the practice followed in the trial Court. Obviously defendants 1 to 9 would have an opportunity to file an additional written statement to the amended plaint. They will be entitled to file an additional written statement within a period of four months from the date of this judgment.”</li>

<p><strong><u>Document ex-facie reveals no title – specific declaration as to invalidity not necessary</u></strong></p>
<p>The Supreme Court held in Kizhakke Vattakandiyil Madhavan v. Thiyyurkunnath Meethal Janaki (Aniruddha Bose &amp; Sudhanshu DhuliaJJ.) 9.4.2024, held as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“18. …. If a document seeking to convey immovable property ex-facie reveals that the conveyer does not have the title over the same, specific declaration that the document is invalid would not be necessary. The Court can examine the title in the event any party to the proceeding sets up this defence. Chiruthey could not convey any property over which she did not have any right or title. Her right, if any, would stem from the second deed of lease (Exhibit A-1). We are conscious of the fact that no claim was made before any forum for invalidating the deed dated 14th July 1910 (Exhibit A-20).”</li>

<p><strong><u>By proving a deed, title of the executing person is not automatically confirmed</u></strong><strong><u></u></strong></p>
<p>The Supreme Court held in Kizhakke Vattakandiyil Madhavan v. Thiyyurkunnath Meethal Janaki (Aniruddha Bose &amp; Sudhanshu DhuliaJJ.) 9.4.2024, also held as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“18. … It would be trite to repeat that even if subsistence of a deed is proved in evidence, the title of the executing person (in this case Chiruthey) does not automatically stand confirmed. ….. … But in absence of proper title over the subject property, that lease deed even if she was its sole lessor would not have had been legally valid or enforceable. If right, title or interest in certain property is sought conveyed by a person by an instrument who herself does not possess any such form of entitlement on the subject being conveyed, even with a subsisting deed of conveyance on such property, the grantee on her successors-in-interest will not have legal right to enforce the right the latter may have derived from such an instrument.”</li>

<p><strong><u>Easement of Necessity – Who has the Burden to show Alternate Way</u></strong></p>
<p>In <strong>Sree Swayam Prakash Ashramam v. G. Anandavally Amma</strong>, AIR 2010 SC 622, it is held that the plaintiff claiming easement of necessity or grant has only a primary burden to prove the <span style="text-decoration: underline">absence of any alternate pathway</span>.</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“In a case where the original plaintiff was claiming easement right either as grant or as of necessity the <strong>plaintiff has only a primary burden </strong>to prove the <strong>absence of any alternate pathway</strong>. As the defendants have not proved the existence of any pathway for access to Plaint `A’ schedule property the version of the plaintiff that there is no alternate pathway shall be accepted. … The defendants have not entered the witness box to disprove the evidence led by the plaintiff.”</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><u>Who has the Onus to show Alternate Way Could Not be Used ‘As Of Right’</u></strong></p>
<p>When the existence of alternate way is shown by the alleged servient owner of easement of necessity, the <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">onus to prove</span></strong> that the way <span style="text-decoration: underline">cannot be used “as of right” is upon the dominant owner.</span> In Antony @ Anthappan v. George,  LAWS(KER) 2012-11-179 it is held by t6he Kerala High Court as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“11. When the existence of an alternate way is shown, the appellants ought to have shown that they could not use it <strong>as of right</strong>. That is because that is a matter within the knowledge of the appellants. The appellants did not adduce evidence in that line.”</li>
</ul>
<p>The High Court then remanded the case giving the dominant owners an opportunity to adduce evidence to show that the alternate way was not one which they were entitled to use as of right.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">No pleading</span><u>; but, Issue Covered by Implication – Evidence can be relied on</u></strong><u> </u></p>
<p>The Supreme Court, in the matter of Standard Chartered Bank v. Andhra Bank Financial Services Ltd., (2006) 6 SCC 94, held that if parties know that a plea was involved in trial and if such a plea is covered by issue by implication then in such a case mere fact that the plea was not expressly taken in pleading would not necessary disentitle a party from relying upon it if it is satisfactorily proved by evidence.</p>
