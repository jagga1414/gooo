<p><strong>Saji Koduvath Advocate, Kottayam</strong> </p>
<p><strong>PART I</strong></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Introduction</strong></span></p>
<p>In Govt. of Kerala v. Joseph, AIR 2023 SC 3988, our Apex Court has emphasised (August 9, 2023), that the Courts have to consider the question of adverse possession “more seriously” when it is claimed on a land that belongs to the Government.</p>
<p>In this case, the judgment of the first appellate court which observed that <strong>‘</strong>the <span style="text-decoration: underline">title of the Government</span> on land cannot be lost by placing reliance on <strong>“<mark class="has-inline-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#6d07cd">casual advertence</mark>”</strong> or on the basis of <strong>“<mark class="has-inline-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#0608ce">scanty material</mark>” ’</strong> was restored by the Apex Court. The Apex Court further held –</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“When the land subject of proceedings wherein adverse possession has been claimed, <span style="text-decoration: underline">belongs to the Government</span>, the <span style="text-decoration: underline">Court is duty-bound</span> to act with greater seriousness, effectiveness, care and circumspection as it may lead to destruction of a right/title of the State to immovable property.”</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">Adverse Possession – Basic Ingredients  </span></strong></p>
<p>The Apex Court also alluded to the following often repeated the basic ingredients to attract the adverse possession, with reference to various previous earlier decisions including the Privy Council –</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>i. the possession must be <span style="text-decoration: underline">open, clear, continuous and <strong>hostile</strong></span> <span style="text-decoration: underline">to</span> the claim or possession of <span style="text-decoration: underline">the other party</span>;</li>
<li>ii. all three classic requirements must coexist – <span style="text-decoration: underline">nec vi</span> (i.e., adequate in continuity); <span style="text-decoration: underline">nec clam</span> (i.e., adequate in publicity); <span style="text-decoration: underline">and nec precario</span> (i.e., adverse to a competitor), <span style="text-decoration: underline">in <strong>denial of title</strong> and <strong>knowledge</strong></span>.</li>

One who holds possession on behalf of another, does not by mere denial of that other’s title make his possession adverse so as to give himself the benefit of the statute of limitation. Therefore, a person <span style="text-decoration: underline">who enters into possession having a lawful title, cannot divest another of that title</span> by pretending that he had no title at all.”</li>

Since the appellant’s claim is founded on Section 53-A, it goes without saying that he admits by implication that he came into possession of the land lawfully under the agreement and continued to remain in possession till date of the suit. Thereby the plea of adverse possession is not available to the appellant.”</li>
<li>11. <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">State of Rajasthan v. Harphool Singh</span>  (2000) 5 SCC 652</strong> –  “12. So far as the question of perfection of title by adverse possession and that too in respect of <strong><u>public property</u></strong> is concerned, the question requires to <span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>be considered more seriously</strong></span> and effectively for the reason that it ultimately involves destruction of right/title of the State to immovable property and conferring upon a third-party encroacher title where he had none.”  “When the property was a vacant land before the alleged construction was put up, to show open and hostile possession which could alone in law constitute adverse to the State, in this case, some concrete details of the nature of occupation with proper proof thereof would be absolutely necessary and <span style="text-decoration: underline">mere vague assertions cannot by themselves </span>be a substitute for such concrete proof required of open and hostile possession.”</li>

<p>PT Munichikkanna Reddy v. Revamma, AIR 2007 SC 1753, is an authoritative decision of the Supreme Court that discussed various views on adverse possession, in the light of Limitation Act, 1963. It is observed in this decision as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“Adverse possession in one sense is based on the theory or presumption that the owner has abandoned<sup>#</sup> the property to the adverse possessor on the acquiescence of the owner to the hostile acts and claims of the person in possession. It follows that sound qualities of a typical adverse possession lie in it being open, continuous and hostile.”
<ul class="wp-block-list">

</ul>
</li>
<li>“<em>Thus, there must be <strong>intention to dispossess</strong>. And it needs to be <strong>open</strong> and <strong>hostile enough</strong> to bring the same <strong>to the knowledge</strong> and plaintiff has an<strong> opportunity to object</strong>.</em>“</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">Period of Limitation against Government is 30 years</span></strong></p>
<p>The limitation period for acquiring <strong>adverse possession against Government is 30 years</strong>. See Article 112 of the Limitation Act. Under the old Act of 1908 it was 60 years.</p>

<p>It is really a troublesome matter for the advocates. Karnataka Board of Wakaf v. Govt of India – AIR 2004 SC 2096; T. Anjanappa v. Somalingappa – [(2006) 7 SCC 570]; and PT Munichikkanna Reddy v. Revamma – AIR 2007 SC 1753, guide us in this field. It may be necessary to plead the following modules.</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><em>The claimant has been in ‘<strong>hostile </strong>and <strong>open, continuous uninterrupted </strong></em><strong>as of right</strong><em>‘ possession of the land,</em></li>
<li><em>in <strong>denial of the title</strong></em> of the rightful owner,</li>
<li><strong><em>adversely</em></strong><em> to the interest</em> of the owner <em>of the land</em>,</li>
<li><strong><em>started </em></strong>with wrongful <strong><em>dispossession</em></strong> of the rightful owner,</li>
<li><em>exercising <strong>absolute rights</strong> of ownership in respect of the land</em>,</li>
<li><em> on and from </em>.. . .. (Specify<em> <strong>date</strong></em>).</li>
</ul>
<p>And, it is appropriate to plead ‘hostile and open’ possession as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Claimant’s acts were<strong> hostile enough</strong> to make the true owner aware of the adverse possession;</li>
<li>or, the claimant <strong><em>made the true owner knew</em> </strong>as to his hostile acts or adverse possession (from the inception).</li>

<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“4. … But it is well-settled that in order to establish <span style="text-decoration: underline">adverse possession of one coheir as against another</span> it is not enough to show that one out of them is in sole possession and enjoyment of the profits, of the properties. <span style="text-decoration: underline">Ouster of the non-possessing co-heir</span> by the co-heir in possession who claims his possession to be adverse, <span style="text-decoration: underline">should be made out</span>. The possession of one co-heir is considered, in law, as possession of all the co-heirs. When one co-heir is found to be in possession of the properties it is presumed to be on the basis of joint title. The co-heir in possession cannot render his possession adverse to the other co-heir not in possession merely by any secret hostile animus on his own part in derogation of the other co-heir’s title. <span style="text-decoration: underline">It is a settled rule of law </span>that as between co-heirs there must be evidence of open assertion of hostile title, coupled with exclusive possession and enjoyment by one of them to the <strong>knowledge of the other</strong> <span style="text-decoration: underline">so as to constitute <strong>ouster.</strong></span> … the burden of making out <strong>ouster</strong> is on the person claiming to displace the lawful title of a co-heir by his adverse possession.” (Quoted in: Hemaji Waghaji Jat v.

<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline"><span style="text-decoration: underline">D</span>egree of Proof on Title in a Civil Case is ‘<span style="text-decoration: underline">High Degree of Probability</span></span></strong>‘</p>
<p>In <strong>R.V.E. Venkatachala Gounder v. Arulmigu Viswesaraswami</strong>, AIR 2003 SC 4548: (2003) 8 SCC 752, the law is stated in the following terms :</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“Being a civil case, the plaintiff cannot be expected to proof his title beyond any reasonable doubt; <span style="text-decoration: underline">a high degree of probability lending assurance of the availability of title with him </span>would be <span style="text-decoration: underline">enough to shift the onus on the defendant</span> and if the defendant does not succeed in shifting back the onus, the plaintiff’s burden of proof can safely be deemed to have been discharged.  …”</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">Is declaration necessary for claiming Adverse Possession by a Plaintiff?</span></strong></p>
<p>Yes. Declaration is needed in the following circumstances:</p>
<ol class="wp-block-list" style="list-style-type:lower-roman">
<li>As <strong><u>Introductory</u></strong>/preliminary to grant (1) Injunction or (2) Recovery (Unnikrishnan v. Ponnu Ammal: AIR 1999 Ker 405</li>
<li>When serious <strong>denial or cloud </strong>on title (or right): Anathula Sudahakar v. Buchi Reddi: <strong>AIR 2008 SC 2033</strong></li>
<li>Asserted title or civil right is <strong><u>not </u></strong>clear, simple and <strong>straight-forward</strong>; or, not<strong> well-established</strong> (lawful possession). (Eg. inchoate rights – started; but, not full-blown, until the such title is upheld by a competent court; like title on adverse possession.)</li>
<li>Complicated or <strong>complex</strong> <strong>questions</strong> of fact and law to be ‘adjudicated’ (Anathula: <strong>2008 SC 2033)</strong></li>
<li><strong>Insurmountable obstacle</strong> – Md. Noorul Hoda v. Bibi Raifunnisa : <strong>(1996) 7 SCC 767</strong></li>
<li>Make clear what is <strong>doubtful</strong> – as to legal character and title. ILR 1970-2 (Del) 433: Eg. Suit by trespasser claiming adverse possession: Darshan Kumari v. Kaushalya Devi: 1990 JKLR 208; 1991 Kash LJ 1 (R.P. Sethi, J) for dispelling cloud: AIR 1953 (Gau) 162.</li>
</ol>
<p>It appears, from the thrust of decisions, that such a declaration is not necessary when a defendant claims the right.</p>
<p><strong><u>Title dispute on Forest Land</u></strong></p>
<p>When title dispute was arisen as to title of land (Forest land or private land) and plantation produce, in  Aliakutty Paul v. State of Kerala, 1995-2 Ker LT 93, it is held as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“It is open to the petitioner to approach the civil court and claim a declaration of her title to the plantation produce kept stored in the godowns and stores of the Rosary Estate. As and when her title is declared, the petitioner would be entitled to take it away. Until then, it has necessarily to be preserved in safe custody.”</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">Should the person who claims adverse possession necessarily know the true owner?</span></strong></p>
<p>There is difference of opinion. </p>
<p>It can be said – “The person who claims adverse possession must necessarily know the true owner, (for) then only it becomes ‘adverse’ as stated in Art. 65 of the Limitation Act.</p>
<p>In Annasaheb Bapusaheb Patil v. Balwant, (1995) 2 SCC 543: AIR 1995 SC 895  (two-Judge Bench) our Apex Court held as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“A person who bases his title on adverse possession must show by clear and unequivocal evidence i.e possession was <strong><u>hostile to the real owner </u></strong>and amounted to a <strong><u>denial of his title</u></strong> to the property claimed.”</li>
</ul>
<p>But, in the <strong>Report of the 22<sup>nd</sup> Law Commission</strong> (From 21st February, 2020 to 31<sup>st</sup> August, 2024) it is stated as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“7.5. Possession must be open and without any attempt at concealment. It is, however, <strong>not necessary</strong> that possession must be so effective as to bring it to the <strong>specific knowledge of the owner</strong> (except ouster).”</li>
</ul>
<p>The Consultation Paper-cum-Questionnaire prepared by the 19<sup>th</sup> Law Commission is attached to the Report of the 22<sup>nd</sup> Law Commission, as “Annexure – 1”. Para 2.6 of the same reads as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“2.6 It was clarified by a <strong>three-Judge Bench</strong> of the Supreme Court in <strong>Kshithish Chandra Bose v. Commissioner of Ranchi,</strong> AIR 1981 SC 707,
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“All that the law requires is that the possession must be open and without any attempt at concealment. It is <strong>not necessary</strong> that the possession must be so effective so as to bring it to the specific <strong>knowledge of the owner</strong>. Such a requirement may be insisted on where an ouster of title is pleaded, but that is not the case here. “</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>“It was also clarified in a series of decisions that while possession shall be open and exclusive and in assertion of one’s own right, the fact that the possessor did not know who the real owner was, will not make his possession any the less adverse. There are certain passing observations in some judgments of the Supreme Court rendered by two learned Judges that the plea of adverse possession is not available if the adverse possessor does not know who the true owner is; but, the law declared by the larger Bench decisions of the Supreme Court obviously prevails.“</li>
</ul>
<p>It appears that the Law Commission inappropriately relied on the Three Judge Bench decision. On a careful reading of this decision, Kshithish Chandra Bose, it can be seen that this decision arose from a matter that emerged prior to 1963 Limitation Act, and when the 1908 Limitation Act reigned the field.</p>
<p>Under the 1908 Act, the true owner was bound to file suit for recovery within 12 years of losing possession. Therefore, it was immaterial – whether the trespasser ‘acquired’ right of <em>‘adverse‘ </em>possession against the true owner; knowing him and bringing his attention to the ‘trespass’, or not (as required in 1963 Act). </p>
<p>While narrating the facts, it is observed in Kshithish Chandra Bose, as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“In the suit the plaintiff based his claim in respect of plot No. 1735, Ward No. I of Ranchi Municipality on the ground that he had acquired title to the land by virtue of a Hukumnama granted to him by the landlord as far back as 17th April, 1912 which is Exhibit 18. Apart from the question of title, the plaintiff further pleaded that even if the land belonged to the defendant municipality, he had acquired title by prescription by being in possession of the land to the <strong>knowledge of the municipality</strong> for more than 30 years, that is to say, from 1912 to 1957.“</li>
</ul>
<p>From the above, it comes out that the person who claims adverse possession <strong>must</strong> <strong>necessarily know the true owner</strong>; and that Kshithish Chandra Bose v. Commissioner of Ranchi, AIR 1981 SC 707, cannot be used to support  the plea that adverse possession is available even if the adverse possessor does not know who the true owner is.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline">Kerala High Court went wrong in K.T. Kurungottukandi Rarichakutty v. Aranda Rarichan, 2018-5 KHC 599</span></p>
<p>Kerala High Court also inappropriately relied on the Three Judge Bench decision of the Supreme Court which held in <strong>Kshitish Chandra Bose v. Commissioner of Ranchi</strong>, AIR 1981 SC 707, that the person who claims adverse possession adverse possession need not know the true owner.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">Adverse Possession Against Government</span></strong></p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><mark class="has-inline-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#1f13f3">There is <strong>presumption available in favour of the government</strong> – that is, all lands which are not the property of any person or which are not vested in a local authority, belong to the government.</mark></li>

</ul>
<p>In <strong>R. Hanumaiah v. Secretary to Government of Karnataka, Revenue Department</strong>, (2010) 5 SCC 203, it was observed that that the Suits for declaration of title against the government, though similar to suits for declaration of title against private individuals differ significantly in some aspects. The first difference is in regard to the presumption available in favour of the government. All lands which are not the property of any person or which are not vested in a local authority, belong to the government.</p>
<p>The Apex Court held as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“15. Suits for declaration of title against the government, though similar to suits for declaration of title against private individuals <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">differ significantly</span></strong> in some aspects. </li>
<li>The first difference is in regard to the presumption available in favour of the government. <span style="text-decoration: underline">All lands which are not the property of any person</span> or which are not vested in a local authority, <span style="text-decoration: underline">belong to the government</span>. All unoccupied lands are the property of the government, unless any person can establish his right or title to any such land. <span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>This presumption available to the government</strong></span>, is not available to any person or individual. </li>
<li>The second difference is in regard to the period for which title and/or possession have to be established by a person suing for declaration of title. Establishing title/possession for a period exceeding twelve years may be adequate to establish title in a declaratory suit against any individual. On the other hand, title/possession for a <span style="text-decoration: underline">period exceeding thirty years will have to be established to succeed in a declaratory suit for title against government</span>. This follows from Article 112 of Limitation Act, 1963, which prescribes a longer period of thirty years as limitation in regard to suits by government as against the period of 12 years for suits by private individuals. The reason is obvious. Government properties are spread over the entire state and it is not always possible for the government to protect or safeguard its properties from encroachments. <span style="text-decoration: underline">Many a time, its own <strong>officers </strong>who are expected to protect its properties and maintain proper records, either due to negligence or <strong>collusion</strong>, create entries in records to help private parties</span>, to lay claim of ownership or possession against the government. </li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline">Any loss of government property is ultimately the </span><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">loss to the community</span>.</strong> Courts owe a duty to be vigilant to ensure that public property is not converted into private property by unscrupulous elements.</li>
<li>16. <span style="text-decoration: underline">Many civil courts</span> deal with suits for declaration of title and injunction against government, in a casual manner, <span style="text-decoration: underline">ignoring or overlooking the<strong> special features</strong> relating to government properties</span>. Instances of such suits against government being routinely decreed, either ex parte or for want of proper contest, merely acting upon the oral assertions of plaintiffs or stray revenue entries are common. Whether the government contests the suit or not, before a suit for declaration of title against a government is decreed, the plaintiff should establish, either his title by producing the title deeds which satisfactorily trace title for a minimum period of thirty years prior to the date of the suit (except where title is claimed with reference to a grant or transfer by the government or a statutory development authority), or by establishing adverse possession for a period of more than thirty years. </li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline">In such suits, courts cannot, ignoring the <strong>presumptions available</strong> in favour of the government</span>, grant declaratory or injunctive decrees against the government by relying upon one of the principles underlying pleadings that plaint averments which are not denied or traversed are deemed to have been accepted or admitted. </li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline">A court should necessarily seek an answer</span> to the following question, before it grants a decree declaring title against the government : 
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline">whether the<strong> plaintiff has produced title deeds</strong></span> tracing the title for a period of more than thirty years; or </li>
<li>whether the plaintiff has <span style="text-decoration: underline">established his adverse possession<strong> </strong>to the <strong>knowledge of the government</strong> </span>for a period of more than thirty years, so as to convert his possession into title. </li>
<li>Incidental to that question, the court should also find out whether the plaintiff is recorded to be the owner or holder or occupant of the property in the revenue records or municipal records, for more than thirty years, and </li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline">what is the <strong>nature of possession claimed</strong></span> by the plaintiff, if he is in possession – authorized or unauthorized; <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">permissive</span></strong>; casual and occasional; furtive and clandestine; open, continuous and hostile; deemed or implied (following a title).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>17. Mere temporary use or occupation without the animus to claim ownership or mere use at sufferance will not be sufficient to create any right adverse to the Government. In order to oust or defeat the title of the government, a<span style="text-decoration: underline"> claimant has to establish a clear <strong>title which is</strong> <strong>superior to or better than the title of the government</strong></span> <span style="text-decoration: underline">or establish perfection of title by adverse possession</span> for a period of more than thirty years with the knowledge of the government. </li>
<li>To claim adverse possession, the possession of the claimant must be actual, open and visible, <strong>hostile to the owner</strong> (and therefore necessarily with the <strong>knowledge of the owner</strong>) and continued during the entire period necessary to create a bar under the law of limitation. In short, it should be adequate in continuity, publicity and in extent. Mere vague or doubtful assertions that the claimant has been in adverse possession will not be sufficient. Unexplained stray or sporadic entries for a year or for a few years will not be sufficient and should be ignored. </li>
<li>As noticed above, many a time <span style="text-decoration: underline">it is possible for a private citizen to get his name entered as the occupant of government land, with the help of <strong>collusive government servants</strong></span>. Only entries based on appropriate documents like grants, title deeds etc. or based upon actual verification of physical possession by an authority authorized to recognize such possession and make appropriate entries can be used against the government. By its very nature, a claim based on adverse possession requires clear and categorical pleadings and evidence, much more so, if it is against the government. Be that as it may.” (Quoted in: Bhagi Ram v. State of H P (2023 April 10), Nathu Ram v. D D A (2022 February 1.)</li>

<li>The ancestors of the plaintiff having close association with the Maratha Government, were <span style="text-decoration: underline">made a grant</span> in respect of the suit land <span style="text-decoration: underline">in the year 1800.</span></li>
<li>The land was <span style="text-decoration: underline">partitioned</span> between the ancestors <span style="text-decoration: underline">in 1819.</span></li>
<li>The Union of India claimed title over the suit land, thus the suit.</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline">UoI averred </span>that the land belonged to it, a part of which has been <span style="text-decoration: underline">leased out to several persons for agriculture work</span> and their lease has been renewed from time to time.</li>

<li>The <span style="text-decoration: underline">trial Court</span> came to the conclusion that the <span style="text-decoration: underline">plaintiff could not prove any kind of grant</span> by the Maratha Government to his ancestors in 1800.</li>
<li>Plaintiff <span style="text-decoration: underline">failed to prove the partition</span> between his ancestors in 1819.</li>
<li>The <span style="text-decoration: underline">lease deed alleged to have been executed in favour of the Military Estate Officer</span> under the Union of India, <span style="text-decoration: underline">was not successfully proved</span>.</li>

<p>The Apex Court Findings –</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>It is not permissible to claim the relief of <span style="text-decoration: underline">declaration without seeking consequential relief </span>by virtue of the proviso of Section 34 of Specific Relief Act, 1963  (Relying on: Ram Saran v. Ganga Devi, AIR 1972 SC 2685, Vinay Krishna v. Keshav Chandra, AIR 1993 SC 957, Gian Kaur v. Raghubir Singh, (2011) 4 SCC 567).</li>
<li>There was <span style="text-decoration: underline">nothing on record</span> to <span style="text-decoration: underline">prove the grant/gift</span> by the Maratha Government in favour of ancestors of plaintiff/respondent No.1 in the year 1800.</li>
<li>A <span style="text-decoration: underline">case not specifically pleaded</span> can be considered by the court. The pleadings in substance contain the necessary averments to make out a particular case and issue has been framed on the point. In absence of pleadings, the court cannot make out a case not pleaded, suo motu (Bachhaj Nahar v. Nilima Mandal, AIR 2009 SC 1103 relied on). Hence the claim of title by virtue of the <span style="text-decoration: underline">Will cannot be taken note of </span>being not based on pleadings.</li>
<li>The <span style="text-decoration: underline">Will had been executed prior to the birth of the plaintiff.</span>  it could not have been taken into consideration without proper scrutiny of facts and, that too, without any pleading.</li>
<li>The alleged <span style="text-decoration: underline">partition </span>in the year 1819 even if had taken place, <span style="text-decoration: underline">cannot be a proof of title</span>.</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline">Presumption under Section 90 </span>of the Evidence Act in respect of 30 years’ old document coming from proper custody relates to the signature, execution and attestation of a document <span style="text-decoration: underline">i.e. to its genuineness</span> but it does <span style="text-decoration: underline">not give rise to presumption of correctness</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline">of every statement</span> contained in it.</li>
<li>The <span style="text-decoration: underline">rent note</span> produced by the UoI (allegedly executed by the forefathers of the plaintiff) did not prove anything. It <span style="text-decoration: underline">could not be linked to prove the title</span>. It was rejected observing as under:
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“The <span style="text-decoration: underline">rent note</span> produced by the appellant/defendant No.1 before the court below does not prove anything in favour of the plaintiff/respondent. The same being a<span style="text-decoration: underline"> vague</span> document is incapable of furnishing any information and, thus, is liable to be rejected. The said document does <span style="text-decoration: underline">not make it clear as who has executed it</span> and <span style="text-decoration: underline">in whose favour </span>the same stood executed. It does <span style="text-decoration: underline">not bear any date</span> as it cannot be ascertained when it was executed. The lease deed cannot be executed without the signature/thumb impression of the lessee. The said lease <span style="text-decoration: underline">does not contain any signature/thumb</span> impression of any lessee and also the tenure of the lease has not been mentioned therein. The <span style="text-decoration: underline">rent</span> has been mentioned as Rs.22/- <span style="text-decoration: underline">without giving any detail</span> as to whether it was per day, fortnightly, monthly, quarterly or yearly or for ever. More so, there is <span style="text-decoration: underline">no reference to the said rent note in the pleadings </span>contained in the plaint, therefore, it is just to be ignored.”</li>
</ul>

<li>UoI produced the <span style="text-decoration: underline">certified copies of the Extract from General Land Register</span> prepared on 15.3.1948 in support of its case and denying title of the plaintiff.</li>
<li>The High Court rejected the same on the ground that the partition among the ancestors of the plaintiff had taken place prior to enactment of the Cantonment Land Administration Rules, 1925, though there is <span style="text-decoration: underline">nothing on record to prove the said partition</span>.</li>
<li>The <span style="text-decoration: underline">General Land Register</span> maintained under the Cantonment Act, 1924 and the Rules made thereunder <span style="text-decoration: underline">are public documents and the certified copies of the same are admissible in evidence</span> in view of the provisions of Section 65 read with Section 74 of the Evidence Act.</li>
<li> It is settled legal position that the <span style="text-decoration: underline">entries made in General Land Register </span>maintained under Cantonment Land Administration Rules is <span style="text-decoration: underline">conclusive evidence of title</span>.

<li>Union of India v. Kamla Verma, (2010) 13 SCC 511). </li>

<li>If the Will was ignored, there was <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">nothing on record to show as how the plaintiff  could claim the title</span>.</strong> The <span style="text-decoration: underline"><mark class="has-inline-color has-primary-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">truth of contents of a document have to be proved like any other fact</mark></span>.</li>
<li>The Will in absence of any pleading could not be taken on record. More so, the Will was not proved in accordance with law i.e. Section 68 of the Evidence Act.</li>
<li>The court <span style="text-decoration: underline">cannot travel beyond the pleadings</span> as no party can lead the evidence on an issue/point not raised in the pleadings and in case, such evidence has been adduced or a finding of fact has been recorded by the Court, it is just to be ignored.</li>
<li>“The <span style="text-decoration: underline">appellate courts</span> (first appellate court as well as the High Court) <span style="text-decoration: underline">examined the title of government </span>instead of the plaintiff/respondent no.1. Such a course was not warranted. <span style="text-decoration: underline"><mark class="has-inline-color has-primary-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><strong>The title of government cannot be disputed</strong></mark></span>. In any event possession of government for decades is not disputed. The plaintiff shifted the case from time to time but failed to prove his title.”</li>
<li>“The first appellate court as well as the High Court recorded a finding that the Union of India failed to prove its title over the suit land. The said courts did not realise that this was not the issue to be determined, rather the <span style="text-decoration: underline"><mark class="has-inline-color has-primary-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">issue had been as to whether the plaintiff was the owner of the suit land</mark></span>.”</li>
