<li>Note – The clause, “as effectually as if the administration had been granted at the moment after his death” is not stated when the Act deals with ‘Probate’. Because, it is evident that the provisions and directions in the will govern all these matters. It is further clear from the definition of administrator, in Sec. 2(a).

<p>In Debi Sankar Bhattacharjee v. Irene David, 1968-1 Cal LT 16, the question came for consideration was as to an intestate <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Anglo-Indian</span> deceased. Court observed as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“After considering Section 211 and Section 212 and the aforesaid other provisions of the Indian Succession Act, I see no reason why such representation was not necessary to be obtained in this case. The tenancy right is undoubtedly a property within the meaning of the said provisions of the Indian Succession Act. Again, it is clearly provided therein that such property cannot vest on anybody else excepting an administrator in case the deceased Anglo-Indian died intestate as was the case here. The defendant has been sued as a trespasser. The defendant seeks to establish her right that she is an heir of the deceased on whom the tenancy right was vested after the death of the tenant. <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Under Section 212 of the Indian Succession Act she is debarred from establishing such right <strong>in any Court</strong> without obtaining a grant of the letter of administration. </span>The tenancy right which is a property left by the deceased could not have vested in her as an heir immediately upon the death of the deceased. She could at best be a person interested to succeed in the tenancy right and in that capacity she could take steps under Section 269 of the Indian Succession Act to protect her tenancy right from anybody who might have interested with it until the grant would be made. By doing so <span style="text-decoration:underline;">she could get an administrator appointed so that such administrator after administering the estate could have the tenancy right vested in her.</span> <span style="text-decoration:underline;">The language of Sections 211 and 212, read with Section 269, would clearly indicate the same. </span>The language of sec. 212 makes it imperative to take out representations to the estate of the deceased. It is further clear that the tenancy right is a property and the vesting takes place only when the appointment is made and not earlier. The function of the administrator after he would be so appointed would be to transfer the monthly tenancy right left by the deceased to the proper heir or heirs as on intestacy and such function would be performed by him in course of his administering the estate of the deceased. Until that would be done the landlord would not be in a position to ascertain who would be the proper tenant under the circumstances in a case governed by the Indian Succession Act.”</li>

<li>“The words of S.213 are not restricted only to those cases where the claim is made by a person directly claiming as a legatee. of the will under which he claims. <span style="text-decoration:underline;">What it says is that <strong>no right</strong> <strong>as an executor or legatee can be established</strong></span><mark class="has-inline-color has-primary-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);"><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong> in any Court</strong></span> </mark>of Justice, <span style="text-decoration:underline;">unless probate or letters of administration</span> have been obtained of the will under which the right is claimed, and therefore it is immaterial who wishes to establish the right as a legatee or an executor.

<p>Division Bench of Kerala High Court in Cherichi v. Ittianam, AIR 2001 Ker 184, held as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“The prohibition under Section 213 of the Act is regarding establishing any right under the Will without getting probate or letters of administration and that section cannot be understood as one by which the vesting of right as per the provisions of the Will is postponed until the obtaining of probate or letters of administration.

<p>In Commissioner v. Mohan Krishan Abrol, (2004)7 SCC 505, it is observed as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“A bare reading of Section 211 shows that the property vests in the executors by virtue of the Will and not by virtue of the probate. Will gives property to the executor; the grant of probate is only a method by which the law provides for establishing the Will. In the case of Kulwanta Bewa v Karam Chand Soni [AIR 1938 Cal  714] it has been held that Section 211 provides that the estate of the deceased vests in the executor; that the vesting is not of the beneficial interest in the property; but only for the purposes of representation. In the case of Meyappa Chetty v. Supramanian Chetty [43 Indian Appeals 113] the Privy Council has held that an <span style="text-decoration:underline;">executor derives his title from the Will and not from probate</span>. The personal property of the testator (including right of action) vests in the executor(s) on the death of the testator. For purposes of deciding this matter, Section 336 of the Act is also relevant as it provides for assent of the executor to the legacy after the death of the testator. It provides that an executor gets divested of his interest as an executor from the death of the testator when he assents to a specific legacy. Section 213 acts as a bar to the establishment of rights under the Will by an executor or a legatee unless probate or letters of administration have been obtained. This bar comes into play only when a right as an executor or a legatee under Will is sought to be established. However, an<span style="text-decoration:underline;"> unprobated Will can be admitted in evidence for </span><strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">collateral purposes</span></strong> in any other proceedings apart from probate proceedings.”</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Can Probate or Letters of Administration</span></strong> <strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">be issued to Movable Property</span></strong></p>
<p>It is clear from Sec. 273 that probate can be issued as to Movable Property also. It reads: </p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>273. <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Conclusiveness of probate or letters of administration</span>. Probate or letters of administration shall have effect over all the property and estate, <span style="text-decoration:underline;">moveable or immoveable</span>, of the deceased, throughout the State in which the same is or are granted, and shall be conclusive as to the representative title against all debtors of the deceased, and all persons holding property which belongs to him, and shall afford full indemnity to all debtors, paying their debts and all persons delivering up such property to the person to whom such probate or letters of administration have been granted.</li>

<p><strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Succession Certificate – Object is Collection of Particular Debts</span>;<span style="text-decoration:underline;"> No General Power</span></strong></p>
<p>As can be seen from the Sec. 372, the main object of a Succession Certificate is to facilitate collection of particular debt or debts due to the deceased creditor. This section reads as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>372. Application for certificate. (1) Application for such a certificate shall be made to the District Judge by a petition signed and verified by or on behalf of the applicant in the manner prescribed by the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908, (5 of 1908.) for the signing and verification of a plaint by or on behalf of a plaintiff, and setting forth the following particulars, namely:</li>
<li> (a) … to  (e) …. </li>
<li>(f) the debts and securities <span style="text-decoration:underline;">in respect of which the  certificate is applied for</span>.</li>
<li> (2) …. …. ….. </li>
<li>(3) Application for such a certificate may be made in respect of any debt or debts due to the deceased creditor or in respect of portions thereof.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Supreme Court explained the object in Shri Banarsi Dass v. Mrs. Teeku Dutta, 2005(4) SCC 449, as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“The main object of a Succession Certificate is to facilitate collection of debts on succession and afford protection to parties paying debts to representatives of deceased persons. <span style="text-decoration:underline;">All that the Succession Certificate purports </span>to do is to <span style="text-decoration:underline;">facilitate the collection of debts</span>, to regulate the administration of succession and to protect persons who deal with the alleged representatives of the deceased persons. </li>
<li>Such a certificate <span style="text-decoration:underline;">does not give any general power of administration on the estate</span> of the deceased. The grant of a certificate does not establish title of the grantee as the heir of the deceased. </li>
<li>A Succession Certificate is intended as noted above to <span style="text-decoration:underline;">protect the debtors,</span> which means that where a debtor of a deceased person either voluntarily pays his debt to a person holding a Certificate under the Act, or is compelled by the decree of a Court to pay it to the person, he is lawfully discharged. </li>
<li>The grant of a certificate <span style="text-decoration:underline;">does not establish a title</span> of the grantee as the heir of the deceased, but only furnishes him with authority to collect his debts and allows the debtors to make payments to him without incurring any risk. In order to succeed in the succession application the applicant has to adduce cogent and credible evidence in support of the application. The respondents, if they so chooses, can also adduce evidence to oppose grant of succession certificate.”</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><u>Probate Operates as a Judgment in Rem</u></strong></p>
<p>The grant of a Probate by Court of competent jurisdiction is in the nature of a judgment in rem and conclusive and binds not only the parties but also the entire world. The principle is laid down by the Supreme Court in the following cases:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Lynette Fernandes v. Gertie Mathias, (2018) 1 SCC 271,</li>
<li>Virendra Kumar Jain v. Asha Goel, 2019-4 All.WC 4033,</li>

<li>Chiranjilal Shrilal Goenka v. Jasjit Singh, (1993) 2 SCC 507.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><u>Probate Court is not competent to determine the question of title</u></strong></p>
<p>The Supreme Court consistently held (Ishwardeo Narain Singh v. Smt Kamta Devi, AIR 1954 SC 280, Chiranjilal Shrilal Goenka , v. Jasjit  Singh, (1993) 2 SCC 507, and  Kanwarjit Singh Dhillon v. Hardyal Singh Dhillon 2008 (1) CTC 80) that the probate Court is not competent to determine the question of title to the suit properties. (See: P.  Dhanakoti v. Devikarani, 2011 4 CTC 593; 2011 3 LW 633)</p>
