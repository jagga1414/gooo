It was argued that this practice is unconstitutional. They claimed right to continue in their parent churches despite their marriage with a non-Knanite Christian. </p>

<p><strong><u>Knanaya Community in Kerala</u></strong></p>
<p>Knanites  constitute a well-known Christian community in Kerala.  The members of this fraternity believe that they are the endogamous-descendants of Syrian-Jewish group who sailed from Syria and landed Kerala in the 4<sup>th</sup> or 8<sup>th</sup> century under the leadership of a merchant, Knayi Thoma.  In any case, it is a fact that this sect follows certain cultural and religious practices of their own, for the past several centuries. It is also a fact that this community steadfastly stick on to endogamy; and marriage of a Knanaya person with a non-Knanaya is not conducted in known Knanaya churches. </p>
<p>Majority of Knanites are Roman Catholic. A portion is with the Syrian Orthodox Church. Distinctiveness of this group is recognised by the Roman Pontiff in 1911 by giving a separate Vicariate (Bishop from their own community, with an independent Diocese), taking note of the century old feud between the Knanites and non-Knanites.</p>
<p>A large number of Knanites in Kerala are migrated to west, especially, USA. A group of these migrants and some progressive youth in Kerala today argue that endogamy is archaic and that it is opposed to Divine law and Cannons of the Church.</p>
<p><strong><u>Suits in Courts.</u></strong></p>
<p>Several Knanites filed civil suits claiming rights in their parent churches despite their marriage with a non-Knanite Christian (in a non-Knanite church). Now, an Association of Knanites won the comprehensive suit filed in Subordinate Court, Kottayam wherein they claimed that the practice of expulsion of Knanites from the Knananya churches for marrying non-knanite is against the Divine law, Canon and various Fundamental Rights guaranteed in Article 25 of the Constitution of India.  The appeal therefrom is dismissed by the District Court, Kottayam (on 2. 9. 2022), affirming the decision of the Subordinate Court.</p>

<p><strong><u>Article 25 and 26 of the Constitution of India</u></strong></p>
<p>The association filed the suit on the claim that endogamy is outmoded and irrational. They based their claims on Article 25(1) of the Constitution of India. Article 25(1) reads as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“25(1). Subject to public order, morality and health and to the other provisions of this Part, <mark class="has-inline-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#0904da"><span style="text-decoration: underline">all persons</span></mark> are equally entitled to freedom of conscience and the <span style="text-decoration: underline">right to freely <mark class="has-inline-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#0904da"><span style="text-decoration: underline">profess, practise and propagate <strong>religion</strong></span></mark></span>.”</li>
</ul>
<p>The Knanaya Church that opposed the suit relied on Article 26(b). It reads as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“26. Freedom to manage religious affairs – Subject to public order, morality and health, every religious <mark class="has-inline-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#1c0ace"><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>denomination</strong> or any <strong>section thereof</strong></span> </mark> shall have the right</li>
<li>(a) … …. ;</li>
<li>(b) <mark class="has-inline-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#0d08dd">to <span style="text-decoration:underline">manage its own affairs</span> in <span style="text-decoration: underline">matters of <strong>religion</strong></span></mark>;</li>
<li>(c) … …. ; and</li>
<li>(d)<mark class="has-inline-color has-foreground-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"> to administer such property in accordance with law</mark>.”     </li>
</ul>
<p><strong><u>Nexus between Art. 25 and 26.</u></strong></p>
<p>Article 25(1) secures fundamental right to ‘<span style="text-decoration: underline">persons</span>’. Article 26 protects right of the ‘<span style="text-decoration: underline">denomination or any section thereof</span>’. Clause (b) of Article 26 provides right ‘to manage <span style="text-decoration: underline">its own affairs in matters of <strong>religion</strong></span>’.</p>

Syed Hussain Ali, AIR 1961 SC 1402. It is held in this decision as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“Whilst we are dealing with this point it may not be out of place incidentally to strike a note of caution and Observe that in order that the practices in question should be treated as a part of religion they must be regarded by the said religion as its <span style="text-decoration: underline"><mark class="has-inline-color has-primary-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">essential and integral part</mark></span>; otherwise even purely secular practices which are not <mark class="has-inline-color has-primary-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">an essential and integral part</mark><span style="text-decoration:underline"> of religion</span> are apt to be clothed with a religious form and may make a claim for being treated as religious practices within the meaning of Art. 26. Similarly, even practices though religious may have sprung from <span style="text-decoration:underline">merely superstitious beliefs</span> and may in that sense be extraneous and unessential accretions to religion itself. Unless such practices are found to constitute <mark class="has-inline-color has-primary-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">an essential and integral part</mark> of a religion their claim for the protection under Art. 26 <span style="text-decoration:underline">may have to be carefully scrutinised</span>; in other words, the <span style="text-decoration:underline">protection must be</span> <span style="text-decoration:underline">confined to</span> such religious practices as are <mark class="has-inline-color has-primary-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">an essential and integral part</mark><span style="text-decoration:underline"><mark class="has-inline-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#3a0fce">of it and no other</mark>.</span>”</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>2.</strong> <strong><u>The teachings of Christ, Divine Law etc.</u></strong></p>
<p>The teachings of Christ, Divine Law (The Bible), provisions of Canon etc. unequivocally stand against the practice of endogamy.  Bible (Galatians – 3: 28) proclaims that ‘<mark class="has-inline-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#0804d6">there is neither Jew nor Greek, slave nor free, male nor female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus</mark>‘. Devine law is  fundamental; no one can disdain Divine law. </p>
<p>When a new vicariat (diocese) was formed in 1911 for Southists (Knanaya), no whisper at all was made in the Bull of Pope to the effect that the people of new vicariat can ignore any basic principle that made fundamentals of Catholic Church.</p>
<p>Canon says that the membership of a Catholic is in his ‘sui juris’ church – that is, in the Rite which he joins or is included. The Knanites in Kerala are under the Syro Malabar Rite.  No independent claim can be raised by Knanites as to the very fundamental matters including the membership in the Church. </p>
<p><strong>3</strong>. <strong><span style="text-decoration:underline">Even if there is ‘Knanaya Community’,  the members cannot be estranged from ‘Diocese’</span></strong></p>
<p>Even if it is assumed that there is ‘Knanaya Community’ with their own characteristic practices,  no one can be expelled from the ecclesiastical ‘Diocese’ under which Knanites are are grouped-in (for he/she had married a non-Knanite); because, it is not supported by any of the provision of Canon and other laws applicable to the Church.</p>
<p><strong>4<u>. Constitutional Morality and Individual Rights</u></strong></p>
<p>Rights guaranteed under Article 26 is ‘subject to public order, <span style="text-decoration:underline">morality</span> and health’. Therefore, the ‘Constitutional morality’, and individual rights that gain primacy, enshrined and projected in <mark class="has-inline-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#0405dd"><strong>Article 14, 15, 17, 21</strong></mark> etc. are to be aptly regarded while considering the rights of ‘religious denomination or any section thereof’ in Article 26. They make it clear that endogamy is opposed to Constitutional morality. In any event, it is illegal, in the teeth of <mark class="has-inline-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#0405dd">Article 14, 15, 17, 21</mark> etc, to estrange a catholic from a Knanaya church for he married a non-knanaya. </p>

<li>Article 25(1) is subject to Article 26.</li>
<li>For a denomination no ‘distinctive’ faith is needed.</li>
<li>Denomination Enjoys Complete Autonomy.</li>
<li>Religious Practices are as important as Faith.</li>
<li>Excommunication on Religious Grounds – part of Management by the Community.</li>
<li>Durgah Committee verdict is an Odd Decision.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration:underline">1. </span><u>Article 25(1) is ‘subject to’ Article 26</u></strong></p>
<p>Article 25(1) speaks about fundamental right secured to ‘persons’.  <span style="text-decoration: underline">Article 25(1) begins</span> with the words – <span style="text-decoration: underline">‘subject to other provisions of this part’</span>.  It includes Article 26(b).  Therefore, the <span style="text-decoration: underline">right of denomination or section thereof prevails over</span> the personal right under Article 25(1).</p>
<p>From the above, it is clear that the argument on ‘Constitutional morality’, with reference to other Articles in the Constitution, has to be looked into in the light of of the clause in Art. 25 that it is ‘subject to’ Art. 26.</p>
<p><strong><u>2. For a denomination no ‘distinctive’ faith is needed</u></strong></p>
<p>Knanites constitute a denomination. They can claim rights under Art. 26.  It is admitted by the parties to the suit that the Knanites have common spiritual organization and distinctive name. It is noteworthy (from <span style="text-decoration: underline">Shirur Mutt</span> case) that to acquire the denominational-status, ‘distinctive faith’ is not needed.</p>
<p>In <span style="text-decoration: underline">The Commr, Hindu Religious Endowments v. Sri Lakshmindra Thirtha Swamiar of Sri Shirur Mutt </span>(AIR 1954 SC 282)<strong> </strong>it is observed –</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>(1) Article 26 contemplates not merely a religious <span style="text-decoration: underline">denomination</span>, but also a <span style="text-decoration: underline">section thereof</span>.</li>

<li>“Ananda Marga appears to satisfy all the three conditions, viz., it is a <span style="text-decoration:underline">collection of individuals who have a system of beliefs</span> which they regard as conducive to their spiritual well-being; they have a common organisation and the collection of these individuals has a distinctive name. Ananda Marga, therefore, can be appropriately treated as a religious <mark class="has-inline-color has-primary-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><span style="text-decoration:underline"><strong>DENOMINATION</strong></span></mark>, within the Hindu religion.” </li>
</ul>
<p>In <strong>S.P. Mittal</strong> <strong>v. Union of India</strong>, AIR 1883 SC 1, Chinnappa Reddy, J. (Minority) observed: </p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“Any Freedom or Right involving the conscience must naturally receive a wide interpretation and the expression ‘religion’ and ‘<span style="text-decoration:underline">religious <mark class="has-inline-color has-primary-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><span style="text-decoration:underline"><strong>DENOMINATION</strong></span></mark></span>‘ must therefore, be interpreted in no narrow, stifling sense but is a <span style="text-decoration:underline">liberal, expansive way</span>”. (Indhu Malhotra, J. quoted this portion in Sabarimala case, Indian Young Lawyers Assn. Vs. State of Kerala: 2019-1 SCC 1, observing that the judgment of Chinnappa Reddy, J. was a ‘concurring’ one.)</li>
</ul>
<p>The majority judgment in S.P. Mittal referred to the argument of Soli Sorabji, Senior Advocate, as to show how the ‘common faith’ doctrine was placed – the argument was that the followers of Aurobindo ‘shared’ common faith (within their denomination).</p>
<p>In other words, to acquire the denominational status, the ‘faith’ of ‘denomination’ need not be distinctive from the faith of others in the same religion.</p>
<p><strong><u>3. <strong><u> Denomination</u></strong> Enjoys Complete Autonomy</u></strong></p>
<p>It is held in The Commr, Hindu Religious Endowments v. Sri Lakshmindra Thirtha Swamiar of Sri Shirur Mutt (AIR 1954 SC 282) as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“Under article 26(b), therefore, a <span style="text-decoration:underline">religious <mark class="has-inline-color has-primary-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><span style="text-decoration:underline"><strong>DENOMINATION</strong></span></mark> or organisation enjoys <strong><mark class="has-inline-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#1a10ce">complete autonomy</mark></strong></span> in the matter of deciding as to<span style="text-decoration:underline"> what rites and ceremonies are essential</span> according to the tenets of the religion they hold and <span style="text-decoration:underline"><strong><mark class="has-inline-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#0f19da">no outside authority</mark></strong> has any jurisdiction</span> to interfere with their decision in such matters.” </li>
</ul>
<p>In the Review Judgment, Kantaru Rajeevaru v. Indian Young Lawyers Association, 2020-2 SCC 1, the Apex Court analysed Shirur Mutt case and said as under:</p>

</ul>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration:underline">4. </span><u>‘Religious Practices’ are as Important as ‘Faith</u></strong>‘</p>
<p>In The Commr, Hindu Religious Endowments v. Sri Lakshmindra Thirtha Swamiar of Sri Shirur Mutt (AIR 1954 SC 282) it is held as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“A religion undoubtedly has its basis in a system of beliefs or doctrines which are regarded by those who profess that religion as conducive to their spiritual wellbeing, but it would not be correct to say that religion is nothing else but a doctrine or belief. <span style="text-decoration:underline">A religion may not only lay down a code of ethical rules for its followers to accept, it might prescribe <strong>rituals and observances</strong></span>, ceremonies and modes of worship which are regarded as integral parts of religion, and these forms and dress.”</li>
</ul>
<p>In Ratilal Panachand Gandhi v. The State of Bombay, AIR 1954 SC 388, it is observed as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“<strong>Religious practices</strong> or performances of <strong><mark class="has-inline-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#1c2deb">ACTS</mark></strong>, in pursuance of religious belief are <span style="text-decoration:underline"><strong><mark class="has-inline-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#1f0cde">AS MUCH A PART</mark></strong> of religion as <strong>faith or belief</strong></span> in particular doctrines.”</li>
</ul>
<p>In Sri Venkataramana Devaru v. State of Mysore, AIR 1958 SC 255, it is held as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“It being thus settled that matters of religion in Art. 26 (b) include even <span style="text-decoration:underline"><strong>practices</strong> which are regarded by the <strong>COMMUNITY</strong></span> as part of its religion ….”</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration:underline">5. Excommunication on Religious Grounds – part of Management by the <span style="text-decoration:underline"><strong>COMMUNITY</strong></span></span></strong></p>
<p>In <strong>Sardar Syedna Taher Saifuddin Saheb Vs. The State of Bombay</strong>, AIR 1962 SC 853, it is held as under: </p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“What appears however to be clear is that where an excommunication is itself based on religious grounds such as lapse from the orthodox religious creed or doctrine (similar to what is considered heresy, apostasy or schism under the Canon Law) or breach of some practice considered as an essential part of the religion by the Dawoodi Bohras in general, excommunication cannot but be held to be for the purpose of maintaining the strength of the religion. It necessarily follows that the <span style="text-decoration:underline">exercise of this power of <strong>excommunication</strong> on religious grounds forms part of the management by the <span style="text-decoration:underline"><strong>COMMUNITY</strong></span></span>, through its religious head, “of its own affairs in matters of religion.” The impugned Act makes even such excommunications invalid and takes away the power of the Dai as the head of the community to excommunicate even on religious grounds. It therefore, clearly interferes with the right of the Dawoodi Bohra community under cl. (b) of Art. 26 of the Constitution.”</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration:underline">That <strong>excommunication</strong> of a member of a <span style="text-decoration:underline"><strong>COMMUNITY</strong></span> will affect many of his civil rights is undoubtedly true</span>. This particular religious <mark class="has-inline-color has-primary-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><span style="text-decoration:underline"><strong>DENOMINATION</strong></span></mark> is possessed of properties and the necessary consequence of excommunication will be that the excommunicated member will lose his rights of enjoyment of such property. It might be thought undesirable that the head of a religious community would have the power to take away in this manner the civil rights of any person. The right given under Art. 26 (b) has not however been made subject to preservation of civil rights. The express limitation in Art. 26 itself is that this right under the several clauses of the article will exist subject to public order, morality and health. It has been held by this Court in Sri Venkataramana Devaru v. The State of Mysore (1) that the right under Art. 26(b) is subject further to cl. 2 of Art. 25 of the Constitution.”</li>
<li>“We shall presently consider whether these limitations on the rights of a religious community to manage its own affairs in matters of religion can come to the help of the impugned Act. It is clear however that apart from these limitations the Constitution has not imposed any limit on the right of a religious community to manage its own affairs in matters of religion. <span style="text-decoration:underline">The fact that <strong>civil rights</strong> of a person are affected by the exercise of this fundamental right under Art. 26(b) is therefore of no consequence.</span> Nor is it possible to say that excommunication is prejudicial to public order, morality and health.”</li>

<li>The <strong>‘essential practices’</strong> of <strong><u>RELIGION </u></strong>alone is considered.</li>
<li>The religious practices ‘that may have sprung from merely superstitious beliefs’ and ‘unessential accretions to religion’ may have to be carefully <mark class="has-inline-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#f21bc4"><span style="text-decoration: underline">scrutinised by the<strong> </strong></span><strong><u>COURT</u></strong>.</mark></li>
</ul>
<p>All five judges in Durgah Committee (PB Gajendragadkar, AK Sarkar, KN Wanchoo, K.C. Das Gupta, N.

<p>Justice Gajendragadkar himself (who authored Dargah Committee Case) explained, as to the enquiry on integral part of religion, in a subsequent Five Judge Bench decision, in <strong>Tilkayat Shri Govindlalji Maharaj Vs. St. of Rajasthan</strong> (BP Sinha, CJ, P.B. Gajendragadkar,  K.N. Wanchoo,  K.C. Das Gupta, J.C Shah JJ.), AIR 1963 SC 1638.  (The bench consisted also of two Judges – K.N. Wanchoo,  K.C. Das Gupta JJ. – in Dargah Committee Case, other than Gajendragadkar, J.). It is held in Tilkayat Case as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“In deciding the question as to whether a given religious practice is an integral part of the religion or not, the test always would be whether it is <span style="text-decoration:underline"><mark class="has-inline-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#1612d0"><strong>REGARDED </strong>as such by the <strong>COMMUNITY</strong></mark></span> following the religion or not.”</li>
<li>“This question (as to essential religious practice) will always have to be decided by the Court and in doing so, the Court may have to enquire whether the practice in question is religious in character and if it is, whether it can be regarded as an integral or essential part of the religion, and the finding of the Court on such an issue will always depend upon the evidence adduced before it as to the <span style="text-decoration:underline"><mark class="has-inline-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#1013e3"><strong>CONSCIENCE</strong> of the <strong>COMMUNITY</strong></mark></span> and the tenets of its religion.”</li>

Rajagopala Ayyangar, Mudholkar, JJ.) it was held by a Constitution Bench (Sinha, C. J. dissenting) of five Judges (consisted of three Judges in Dargah Committee Case – A.K. Sarkar, K.C. Das Gupta, N. Rajagopala Ayyangar, JJ.) as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“The content of Arts. 25 and 26 of the Constitution came up for consideration before this Court in the Commissioner, Hindu Religious Endowments Madras v. Sri Lakshmindra Thirtha Swamiar of Sri Shirur Matt; Mahant Jagannath Ramanuj Das v. The State of Orissa; Sri Venkatamana Devaru v. The State of Mysore; Durgah Committee, Ajmer v. Syed Hussain Ali and several other cases and the main principles underlying these provisions have by these decisions been placed beyond controversy. The first is that the protection of these articles is not limited to matters of doctrine or belief they <span style="text-decoration:underline">extend also to <strong>ACTS done</strong> in pursuance of religion</span> and therefore contain a guarantee for rituals and observances, ceremonies and modes of worship which are integral parts of religion. The second is that <span style="text-decoration:underline">what constitutes an essential part</span> of a religious or religious practice <span style="text-decoration:underline">has to be decided by the courts with reference to the doctrine of a particular religion and include practices which are <strong><mark class="has-inline-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#140fd3">REGARDED by the </mark></strong></span><strong><span style="text-decoration:underline"><mark class="has-inline-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#140fd3">COMMUNITY</mark></span></strong><span style="text-decoration:underline"><strong> </strong>as a part of its religion</span>.</li>

<p>In the Sabarimala review-reference (to higher Bench) Judgment, Kantaru Rajeevaru v. Indian Young Lawyers Association, 2020-2 SCC 1, it is pointed out that there is <span style="text-decoration:underline">apparent conflict</span> between the Shirur Mutt Case and Durgah Committee Case.</p>
<p>It is observed –</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Seven Judges bench of the Apex Court, in Commissioner, Hindu Religious Endowments, Madras v.

<p>It is further contended that the circumstances that led to issuance of the 1911 Bull is clear from the words of the Bull as well as the documents referred to therein – that is, the letters of the Bishops in Kerala and the representative of Pope. These documents refer to the need of special consideration of Knanites.  The subsequent conduct of the Church also is important. It is a fact that Bishops from their own community is ordained for Knanites. Knanaya Diocese has no territorial limit in  jurisdiction whereas all other Catholic Dioceses (within Kerala) has territorial limit. </p>
