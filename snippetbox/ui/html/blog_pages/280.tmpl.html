<p><strong><u>Will – Attestation under Sec. 63(c) of the Succession Act</u></strong></p>
<p>Sec. 63(c) of the Succession Act, 1925 says how Wills have to be executed. It is laid down as under.</p>
<p>Sec. 63(c) of the Indian Succession Act –</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“63. <span style="text-decoration: underline">Execution of unprivileged wills</span>––Every testator, not being a soldier employed in an expedition or engaged in actual warfare, or an airman so employed or engaged, or a mariner at sea, shall execute his will according to the following rules––</li>
<li>.(a) …..</li>
<li>(b) …..</li>
<li>(c) The will shall be attested by two or more witnesses, each of whom
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong><u>has</u></strong> seen the testator sign or affix his mark to the will or has seen some other person sign the will, in the presence and by the direction of the testator,</li>
<li>or</li>
<li><strong><u>has</u></strong> received from the testator a personal acknowledgment of his signature or mark, or of the signature of such other person;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>and each of the witnesses shall sign the will in the presence of the testator,
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>but it shall not be necessary that more than one witness be present at the same time, and no particular form of attestation shall be necessary.”</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><u>It is not Necessary – Witnesses must See Execution of Will</u></strong></p>
<p>The attestation of a Will, under Sec. 63 of the Succession Act can be made –</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong><u>either by</u></strong></li>
<li>the witnesses who have “seen the testator sign or affix his mark”</li>
<li><strong><u>or by</u></strong></li>
<li>the witnesses who have “<span style="text-decoration: underline">received from the testator a personal acknowledgment </span>of his signature or mark”.</li>
</ul>
<p>That is, both the attesting witnesses need not be present at the time of execution of the Will. And, one witness need not see the other attests the Will. It is fortified by last limb of Sec. 63 Succ. Act.</p>
