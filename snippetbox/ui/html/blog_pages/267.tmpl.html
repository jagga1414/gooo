<p><strong><span style="text-decoration:underline">What is brought about by Section 65B, Evidence Act?</span></strong></p>
<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li><span style="text-decoration:underline">Sec. 65B</span> of the Evidence Act <span style="text-decoration:underline">enables a litigant to prove <em>computer output</em></span> (derived from original – secondary evidence) ‘<em><span style="text-decoration:underline">without further proof or production of electronic record</span></em>’ (<em>original</em>), <span style="text-decoration:underline">provided the conditions</span> laid down in Sec. 65B(2) <span style="text-decoration:underline">are fulfilled</span> (such as: the computer was operating properly, the electronic record is derived from such information fed into the computer in the ordinary course of the activities, etc.). Sec. 65B declares that the computer output <span style="text-decoration:underline">(copy or print out) ‘</span><em><span style="text-decoration:underline">shall be deemed to be also a document</span></em>‘.
<ul class="wp-block-list">

<li>Note: If the computer was one not used regularly, or the information was one not ‘regularly fed’ into the computer in the ordinary course, etc., Sec. 65B cannot be invoked (‘without further proof or production of the original’).

</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration:underline">Still simpler provisions are introduced to prove ‘<strong>statements</strong>‘</span> (call-records of phones, bank-account-statements, etc.), inasmuch as:

<li>There is <span style="text-decoration:underline">presumption as to correctness</span> (not truth) of the computer output (copy or print out) <span style="text-decoration:underline">under Sec. 65B(5)(c)</span>, as it provides:

</ol>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration:underline">PART I – GENERAL</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><u>Relevancy, <strong>Admissibility</strong> and <strong>Probative Value of Documents</strong> </u></strong></p>
<p>Sec. 5 and 136 of the Evidence Act stipulate that evidence can be given only on ‘facts in issue’ or ‘relevant facts’. Relevant facts are enumerated in Sec. 6 onwards.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, all relevant documents are admissible. But, various provisions of the Evidence Act, Civil and Criminal Procedure Codes, Stamp Act, Registration Act etc. stipulate various formalities or regulations for tendering documents in evidence.</p>
<p>Whenever a document is admitted in court, the probative value thereof will be a matter for the court to determine. In State of Bihar v. Radha Krishna Singh (AIR 1983 SC 684) it is observed:</p>
<ul class="has-small-font-size wp-block-list">
<li><em>“Admissibility of a document is one thing and its probative value quite another—these two aspects cannot be combined. A document may be admissible and yet may not carry any conviction and weight or its probative value may be nil.”</em></li>
</ul>
<p><strong><u>Electronic Record</u></strong></p>
<p>Section 2(1)(t) of the Information Technology Act, 2000 defines an ‘electronic record’ as under:</p>
<ul class="has-small-font-size wp-block-list">
<li>“<span style="text-decoration:underline">electronic record</span>” means data, record or data generated, image or sound stored, received or sent in an electronic form or micro film or computer generated micro fiche;</li>
</ul>
<p>Technically, the ‘electronic record’ will be (i) the data (E-mails, telephonic recordings, CCTV footage, etc.) or (ii) other material in an electronic form (video recordings in CD, DVD), so also the (iii) microfilm, the computer-generated microfiche, etc. attached, or attachable, to a computer, or other electronic equipment.  </p>
<p>It can be seen that our Apex Court, in the following (earlier) cases,  had held that the <span style="text-decoration:underline">tape records</span> of conversations and speeches were admissible under the Indian Evidence   Act:</p>
<ul class="has-small-font-size wp-block-list">

</ul>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration:underline">CD, Pen Drive etc.  into which information is directly fed into</span> <span style="text-decoration:underline">are ‘<em>Electronic Records</em>‘</span></strong></p>
<p>By virtue of the provisions of the Evidence Act (Sec. 3, 22A, 59 and 62) the (original) CD, Pen Drive, Memory Card etc., into which information is <span style="text-decoration:underline">directly fed into</span>, are  ‘<em>electronic records</em>‘ [State of Gujarat v. Shailendra Kamalkishor Pande: 2008 CriLJ 953 (Gujrat) ] ; and they are also <em>Primary Evidence</em>. They are subject to Sec. 22A and Sec. 59, Evid. Act. </p>
<p style="line-height:0"><span style="text-decoration:underline">Sec. 22A Reads as follows</span>:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“<span style="text-decoration:underline">Sec. 22A</span>. <span style="text-decoration:underline">When oral admission as to contents of electronic records are relevant</span>: Oral admissions as to the contents of electronic records are not relevant, unless the genuineness of the electronic record produced is in question.”  </li>
</ul>
<p style="line-height:0"><u>Sec. 59 Reads as under:</u></p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“<u><span style="text-decoration:underline">Sec. 59</span></u>. <span style="text-decoration:underline">Proof of facts by oral evidenc</span>e: All facts, except the contents of documents or electronic records, may be proved by oral evidence.”</li>
</ul>
<p>‘Electronic record’ being perceived, in the Evidence Act, as the <em>‘original’</em> data, record, etc. that are put in or stored, casually, the ‘hard-disc’ of the computer is the ‘electronic record’ (rather than the computer itself); and it can also be an external hard-disc, CD, DVD or a chip or a memory-card or a pen-drive to which the ‘information’ is <span style="text-decoration:underline">directly fed into</span> – using a computer, a video camera, mobile phone, etc. [State of Gujarat v. Shailendra Kamalkishor Pande: 2008 CriLJ 953 (Gujrat) ].   It must have been self-generated without any human intervention. [Kishan Tripathi @ Kishan Painter v. The State (2016) 2 DLT (Cri) 666)]. </p>
<p><span style="text-decoration:underline">Audio and Video Recordings</span> were found to be relevant and admissible as ‘documents’ under section 3 of the Indian Evidence Act, in earlier cases.  See:</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration:underline"><strong>CCTV Footage is a strong piece of evidence </strong></span></p>
<p>In Tomaso Bruno v. State of Uttar Pradesh, (2015) 7 SCC 178, Justice R. Banumathi, Justice Kurian Joseph and Justice Anil R. Dave observed as under: </p>
<ul class="has-small-font-size wp-block-list">
<li>“CCTV footage is a strong piece of evidence which would have indicated whether the accused remained inside the hotel and whether they were responsible for the commission of a crime. It would have also shown whether or not the accused had gone out of the hotel. CCTV footage being a crucial piece of evidence, it is for the prosecution to have produced the best evidence which is missing. Omission to produce CCTV footage, in our view, which is the best evidence, raises serious doubts about the prosecution case.”</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><u>Computer Output</u></strong></p>
<p>According to Sec. 65B(1), <strong>‘<em><u>computer output</u></em>’</strong> is ‘any information contained in an electronic record which is</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>printed on a paper,</li>
<li>stored, recorded or copied in optical or magnetic media produced by a computer’.</li>
</ul>
<p>Section 65B(1) declares that the <em>‘computer output’</em></p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>‘shall be <em><span style="text-decoration:underline">deemed to be also a document</span></em>, if the conditions mentioned in this section are satisfied in relation to the information and computer in question’ (such as: computer was used regularly and operating properly, information was regularly fed into in the ordinary course, etc.); and</li>
<li>‘shall be admissible in any proceedings, without further proof or production of the original, as evidence’.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong><span style="text-decoration:underline">PART II – SEC. 65A and 65B</span></strong></p>
<p>Section 65A is only an introductory provision to Sec. 65B. It does not control Section 65B. Sec. 65A reads: </p>
<ul class="has-small-font-size wp-block-list">
<li>“The <em><u>contents</u></em> of <em>electronic records</em> <strong><span style="text-decoration:underline">may be</span></strong><span style="text-decoration:underline"> <em>proved</em> </span>in accordance with the provisions of section 65B”.</li>
</ul>
<p>Therefore, it is clear, on a reading of both Sec. 65A and Sec. 65B:</p>
<ul class="has-small-font-size wp-block-list">
<li>Section 65B deals with <strong>‘<em><u>admissibility’</u></em></strong> of <strong>‘</strong><em><u>computer output<strong>’</strong></u></em> (perceived as <strong><em>secondary evidence</em></strong>); and </li>
<li>it does not deal with proof/truth of contents of the ‘<em><u>electronic record</u></em>’  (perceived as <strong><em>primary evidence</em></strong>) as such.</li>
</ul>
<p>Indian Evidence Act is amended in 2000 and introduced Sections 65A &amp; 65B with a view to render a simple procedure to admit ‘<em>computer output</em>’, in evidence. It is explicit from the introductory part of Sec. 65B(1), which reads as under: </p>
<ul class="has-small-font-size wp-block-list">
<li><em>“Notwithstanding anything contained in this Act, any information contained in an electronic record which is printed on a paper, stored, recorded or copied in optical or magnetic media produced by a computer (hereinafter referred to as the <strong>computer output</strong>) shall be … <strong>admissible</strong> in any proceedings, without further proof or production of the original, as evidence….”</em></li>
</ul>
<p>It is noteworthy that the ambiguity as to whether electronic<em>–records</em> are also ‘documents’ is already removed by the amendment to Sec. 3 Evd. Act. (<em>‘<strong>Evidence</strong>’ means and includes … .. all documents including electronic records’.)</em>  ‘Electronic records’ being already declared as ‘documents’ by the Evidence Act, Section 65B (1) needed to declare ‘computer output’ (<span style="font-size:revert;background-color:var(--global--color-background);color:var(--global--color-foreground);font-family:var(--global--font-secondary)">perceived as </span>secondary evidence) alone as documents.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration:underline">Section 65B is a borrowed provision</span></strong></p>
<p>Section 65B is brought to Indian law from Section 5 of the UK Civil Evidence Act, 1968. It remains a sheer fact that by the time we borrowed this provision  from the UK law, they repealed (1995) it. (It is pointed out in Arjun Panditrao v. Kailash Kushanrao, (2020) 3 SCC 216, itself.)</p>
<p>The present UK Act (Civil Evidence Act 1995) does not make any special provision for Electronic Evidence or Computerised Records. It deals this matter under the head ‘hearsay evidence’ and makes ‘safeguards’ with respect to the hearsay evidence.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration:underline">Landmark Decisions</span></strong></p>
<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>State (NCT of Delhi) v. Navjot Sandhu</strong>, (2005) 11 SCC 600,  two- judge bench decision. It is held:
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“Irrespective of the compliance with the requirements of Section 65B, which is a provision dealing with admissibility of electronic records, there is <span style="text-decoration:underline">no bar to adducing secondary evidence</span> under the other provisions of the Evidence Act, namely, <span style="text-decoration:underline">Sections 63 and 65</span>. It may be that the certificate containing the details in sub-section (4) of Section 65-B is 26 not filed in the instant case, but that does not mean that secondary evidence cannot be given even if the law permits such evidence to be given in the circumstances mentioned in the relevant provisions, namely, Sections 63 and 65.”</li>

<li><strong>Anvar PV v. PK Basheer</strong>, (2014-10 SCC 473), <strong>three- judge</strong> bench decision. It is held:

<li>“<span style="text-decoration:underline">That </span>(Sections 65A &amp; 65B) <span style="text-decoration:underline">is a complete code in itself.</span> Being a special law, the <span style="text-decoration:underline">general law under Sections 63 and 65 has to yield</span>.”</li>
<li>But finally held: “It is clarified that notwithstanding what we have stated herein in the preceding paragraphs on the secondary evidence of electronic record with reference to Sections 59, 65A and 65B of the Evidence Act, if an <span style="text-decoration:underline">electronic record as such is used as primary evidence under Section 62</span> of the Evidence Act, <span style="text-decoration:underline">the same is admissible in evidence</span>, without compliance with the conditions in Section 65B of the Evidence Act.”</li>

<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Tomaso Bruno (2015) was followed in. It was held as under:</li>
<li>“(11) The applicability of procedural requirement under Section 65B(4) of the Evidence Act of furnishing certificate is to be applied only when such electronic evidence is produced by a person who is in a position to produce such certificate being in control of the said device and not of the opposite party. <span style="text-decoration:underline">In a case where electronic evidence is produced by a party who is not in possession of a device, applicability of Sections 63 and 65 of the Evidence Act cannot be held to be excluded</span>. In such case, procedure under the said Sections can certainly be invoked. If this is not so permitted, it will be denial of justice to the person who is in possession of authentic evidence/witness but on account of manner of proving, such document is kept out of consideration by the court in absence of certificate under Section 65B(4) of the Evidence Act, which party producing cannot possibly secure. Thus, requirement of certificate under Section 65B(h) [sic-65B(4)] is not always mandatory. </li>
<li>(12) Accordingly, <span style="text-decoration:underline">we clarify the legal position</span> on the subject on the admissibility of the electronic evidence, <span style="text-decoration:underline">especially by a party who is not in possession of device</span> from which the document is produced. Such party cannot be required to produce certificate under Section 65B(4) of the Evidence Act.

<p style="line-height:1.4"><strong>1.</strong> Section 65B(4) allows a simple procedure  of furnishing a <strong>Certificate</strong> ‘where it is desired to give a <strong>statement</strong><em> in evidence</em> by virtue of this section’; that is, to admit a <strong><em>statement</em></strong><em> (</em>which is a ‘computer output’), without further proof or production of the original.

<p>“<span style="text-decoration:underline">What is a ‘<strong><em>statement</em></strong>’ according to the Evidence Act”?</span></p>

<p style="line-height:1.4">Thus it appears that the call-records of phones, bank-account-statements etc. alone can be proved as ‘statements’. The ‘statement’ referred to herein is that which can be pointed out “identifying the electronic <span style="text-decoration:underline">record containing the statement</span> and describing the manner in which <span style="text-decoration:underline">it was produced</span>” as stated in Section 65B(4)(a); and which can be ‘<strong>purporting to be signed</strong>‘, as stated in Section 65B(4)(c). And, it is clear that the ‘statement’ does not pertain to other ‘information’ like CCTV Footage, photo in a pen-drive or video in a CD (See also: Sec. 3 (definition of ‘evidence’), Sec. 8 Explanations, Sec. 32 to 39, 145, 157, and 158). (Note – contra view in Supreme Court decisions).</p>
<p style="line-height:1.4"><strong>2.</strong> It is further stated in Section 65B(4) that such Certificate (i) ‘purporting to be signed by a person occupying a responsible official position in relation to the operation of the relevant device or the management of the relevant activities (whichever is appropriate) <em>shall be evidence</em> of any matter stated in the certificate; and (ii) for the purposes of this subsection it shall be sufficient <em>for a matter to be stated</em> to the best of the knowledge and belief of the person stating it’.</p>
<p><strong>3.</strong> It is noteworthy that it is expressly stated: </p>
<ul class="has-small-font-size wp-block-list">
<li>the certificate ‘shall be <strong><em>evidence</em> </strong>of any matter stated in the certificate’.</li>
<li>a ‘computer output’ (including printout or computer-copy of <em>statement</em>) can be admitted without  further proof or production of the original, if conditions laid down are satisfied (such as: computer was used regularly and operating properly, information was regularly fed into in the ordinary course, etc.).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>4.</strong> The certificate must be ‘doing <strong><em><u>any of</u></em></strong> (?) the following things’:</p>
<ul class="has-small-font-size wp-block-list">
<li><strong>(a)</strong> particulars for identifying the <span class="uppercase">ELECTRONIC RECORD <strong><span style="text-decoration:underline">CONTAINING</span> THE STATEMENT</strong></span><strong> </strong>and describing the manner in which <strong>it </strong>was produced;</li>
<li><strong>(b)</strong> such particulars of any device involved in the production of that (original) electronic record as may be appropriate for the purpose of showing that the (original) electronic record was produced by a computer;</li>
<li><strong>(c)</strong> matters that deal with any of (?) the conditions mentioned in sub-section (2) (such as: computer was used regularly and operating properly, information was regularly fed into in the ordinary course, etc.).</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="text-decoration:underline"><strong>‘Statement‘ in S. 65B(4) is the “STATEMENT ‘CONTAINED‘ IN THE ELECTRONIC RECORD” and NOT that GIVEN IN COURT</strong></span></p>
<p>Now, the potential question that arises for consideration is the following:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Whether the ‘statement’ mentioned in Sec. 65B(4) is</strong>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>(i) that given in court, to support the copy or printout, or</strong></li>
<li><strong>(ii) that is contained in the electronic record?</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>It is beyond doubt that the ‘statement’ mentioned in Sec. 65B(4) is not the one that is given in court; but, the <strong>statement</strong> ‘<strong>CONTAINED</strong>‘ <strong>in “the electronic record”. </strong>Because:</p>
<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li>The <strong>“statement</strong>” referred to in Sec. 65B (4) is one that-
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>may be:
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“<strong>desired to</strong> <strong>give</strong>” “<strong>in evidence</strong> by virtue of this section” (Sec. 65B(4) first clause); and</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The “<strong>certificate</strong>”-
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>must be one that
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“identifying the ELECTRONIC RECORD <strong><span style="text-decoration:underline">CONTAINING</span> THE STATEMENT </strong>and describing the manner in which <strong>it </strong>was produced” [Section 65B(4)(a)].</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The above view is fortified by the following:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Sec. 65B(4) says that the certificate
<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li>must state, under Sec. 65B(4)(c), among other things, facts as to “dealing with any of the matters to which the conditions mentioned in <strong>sub-section (2)</strong> relate”
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Note: Proving matter with’ certificate’ under Sec. 65B(4) is a species and proving the conditions laid down in Sec. 65B(2) is genus.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>could be signed by a person who has
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“a responsible <strong>official</strong> <strong>position</strong> in relation to the <strong>operation of the relevant device </strong>or the management of the relevant activities” (Section 65B(4)(c).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Thus, the formal assertions like statements of witnesses, call-records of phones, bank-account-statements, etc. alone can be proved as ‘<strong>statements</strong>’, by virtue of section 65B; and not ‘<strong>information</strong>’ like CCTV Footage, photo in a pen-drive or video in a CD.</p>
<p>In short, going by Sec. 65B, it is definite that-</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>the computer-output (copy) containing the <strong>‘information’</strong> (e.g. CCTV Footage, photo or video in a CD) in the electronic-record (original) can be admitted in evidence, under Sec. 65B, if only the conditions (such as: the computer was operating properly, the electronic record is derived from such information fed into the computer in the ordinary course of the activities, etc.) mentioned in Sec. 65B(2) are satisfied (that is, the conditions are to be proved through the <span style="text-decoration:underline">usual mode</span> of oral evidence or affidavit); and</li>
<li>the ‘<strong><span style="text-decoration:underline">statements</span>’</strong> (e.g. call-records of phones, bank-account-statements) <span style="text-decoration:underline">alone can be admitted</span> in evidence, under Sec. 65B (by computer-output, without further proof or production of the original electronic-record), <span style="text-decoration:underline">through a ‘<strong>certificate</strong></span>‘ (Note – Contra view in Court decisions. In the binding Court decisions it is stated that sans the Certificate, no computer-output can be taken into consideration).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration:underline">Admissibility and Presumption as to correctness of Computer Output</span></strong></p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Sec. 65B does not deal with ‘truth’ of the contents of the electronic record; it deals with only ‘admissibility of copy’. </li>
<li>The electronic record mentioned in Sec. 65B is – that is ‘<strong>relevant</strong>‘; for, it must be one “of which direct evidence would be admissible”.</li>
<li>Therefore, if truth is in question, it must be proved according to other provisions of the evidence act; ie. by <span style="text-decoration:underline">oral, documentary (such as admission) or presumptive (including circumstantial) evidence</span>.

<li>Relevant portions of 65A &amp; 65B read as under:

</ul>
</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration:underline">Sec. 65B: Admissibility<strong> </strong>of electronic records</span>:
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>(1) … any information contained in an electronic record which is <span style="text-decoration:underline">printed</span> ….. or <span style="text-decoration:underline">copied</span><strong> </strong>….. shall be <strong><span style="text-decoration:underline">ADMISSIBLE</span></strong> in any proceedings ….. as evidence of any contents of the original … of <strong>which direct evidence would be admissible</strong>.”</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Sec. 65B declares and expressly lays down that computer output (copy or print)</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>(i) shall be deemed to be also a document, if the conditions mentioned in this section are satisfied in relation to the information and computer in question and</li>

<li>of any contents of the original or</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration:underline">of any fact stated therein</span> of which direct evidence would be admissible.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If the conditions mentioned in this Section Sec. 65B(2) are satisfied, by necessary implication, it will bring a presumption under Sec. 114 with respect to regularity of the computer output . Because, <span style="text-decoration:underline">admissibility of ‘any fact stated therein‘ ‘without further proof’ is nothing but ‘presumption’</span> of its regularity and correctness. The net result is that (if the conditions in Sec. 65B(2) are satisfied) the burden to prove otherwise is cast on the person who opposes it.</p>
<p>The requirement in Sec. 65B(2) as to ‘proof’ (through witnesses or certificate) for ‘regularity‘ of feeding information into the computer in the ‘ordinary course‘ eloquently support this proposition.</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Note:
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>(i) ‘Statements’ alone can be proved by ‘certificate’ under Sec. 65B(4); other ‘information’ are to be proved by proper evidence.</li>
<li>(ii) Presumption of ‘regularity’ under Sec. 114 Evd. Act can be applied in Sec. 65B.</li>
<li>(iii) Presumption of a ‘fact or regularity’ under Sec. 114 Evd.  Act is, essentially presumption of ‘Truth’ and ‘Correctness’.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><u>Presumption of Fact Means Truth/Correctness of Fact</u></strong></p>
<p>St. of West Bengal Vs. Mir Mohammad Omar (AIR 2000 SC 2988) it is held by our Apex Court as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><em>“Presumption of fact is an inference as to the existence of one fact from the existence of some other facts, unless the truth of such inference is disproved. Presumption of fact is a rule in law of evidence that a fact otherwise doubtful may be inferred from certain other proved facts. When inferring the existence of a fact from other set of proved facts, the Court exercises a process of reasoning and reach a logical conclusion as the most probable position. The above principle has gained legislative recognition in India when Section 114 is incorporated in the Evidence Act. It empowers the Court to presume the existence of any fact which it thinks likely to have happened. In that process Court shall have regard to the common course of natural events, human conduct etc. in relation to the facts of the case.”</em></li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration:underline">A combined reading of Section 65A and 65B will show:</span></strong></p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>(i)</strong> ‘<em>Electronic record</em>’ is <em>primary evidence<span style="text-decoration:underline"> (original</span>) and </em>‘<em>computer output’</em>  is derived-from-original;
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>‘<em><u>Computer output’</u></em> (<em>derived from original</em>) stands akin to secondary evidence because: (i) it is (Sec. 65B) an<em> ‘information contained in an electronic record which is printed on a paper, stored, recorded or copied in optical or magnetic media produced by a computer</em>‘;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>(ii)</strong> it is stated that a ‘<em><u>Computer output’</u></em>  “shall be <strong>admissible</strong> in any proceedings, <strong>without</strong> further proof or production of the<strong> original</strong>, as evidence of any contents of the original or of any fact stated therein of which direct evidence would be admissible”;
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Sans Sec. 65B, the provision for proving ‘computer output’ is Sec. 65 read with Sec. 63.</li>
<li>Certificate<strong> </strong>under Section 65B(4) of the Evidence Act is<strong> </strong>required only for proving ‘<u><span style="text-decoration:underline">computer </span></u><span style="text-decoration:underline"><u>output’</u> </span>(derived from original)  and not for proving an ‘Electronic Record'(<em>original</em>); </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>(iii)</strong> Sec. 65B of the Evidence Act enables a litigant to prove <em>computer output</em> (derived from original) <span style="text-decoration:underline">without further proof or production of  </span>‘<em>electronic record</em>’ (<em><span style="text-decoration:underline">original</span></em>) if the conditions laid down in Sec. 65B are fulfilled (such as: computer was used regularly and operating properly, information was regularly fed into in the ordinary course, etc.).</li>
<li><strong>(iv)</strong> Original (<span style="text-decoration:underline">electronic record</span>) can be given in evidence producing and proving ‘original’.  Sec. 65B is an enabling provision to prove ‘<em><u>computer output’</u></em> (copy/print).</li>
<li><strong>(v)</strong> The enabling provision, Sec. 65B of the Evidence Act does not stand as a bar for proving a secondary evidence of the ‘<em>electronic record</em>’ (original – primary evidence), under Sec. 65 read with Sec. 63 of the Evidence Act. (Contra view in Arjun Panditrao).</li>
<li><strong>(vi)</strong> There is presumption as to correctness of the computer output (not truth of contents), under Sec. 65B 5(c), as it reads ‘a computer output (print or copy) shall be <span style="text-decoration:underline">taken to have been produced by a computer</span> whether it was produced by it directly or (with or without human intervention) by means of any appropriate equipment’. </li>
</ul>
<p>Then, the very important question in this subject is the following:</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration:underline">Does the duo by Sec. 65A &amp; 65B Evid. Act Oust the Operation of Sec. 63 &amp; 65?</span></strong></p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>That is, whether ‘computer output’ (secondary evidence of the ‘ electronic record’) can be proved only by Sec. 65B and it Constitute a ‘Complete Code’?</li>
</ul>
<p>The Answer is <strong>No.</strong> </p>
<p><span style="text-decoration:underline">Then, what does the non-obstante clause (‘Notwithstanding anything’) denote</span>? It is clear that Sec.62 to 65 are independent from the new provisions, Sec. 65A and 65B; and Sec. 62 to 65 can also be invoked to prove ‘computer output’ (secondary evidence of the ‘ electronic record’).  It is definite that the non-obstante clause (‘Notwithstanding anything contained in the Act .. .. ’) in Sec. 65B does not oust Sections 63 and 65 of the Evidence Act in proving a computer output (secondary evidence). Because:</p>
<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li>Sec. 65A is an introductory provision to Sec. 65B.</li>
<li>Sec. 65A does not control Sec. 65B.</li>
<li>Sec. 65A directs only an (enabling) method to <em>PROVE</em> (not the only one method) the <em><u>CONTENTS</u></em> of <em>electronic records</em> –  by print/copy – invoking Sec. 65B.
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>(Sec. 65A reads: The contents of <em>electronic records</em><strong> <em>may be</em></strong> <em>proved</em><strong> </strong>in accordance with the provisions of section 65B.) </li>
<li>Thus, Sec. 65B is an Enabling or Added provision; and, other enabling (existing) provisions in the Indian Evidence Act, to prove documents by secondary evidence invoking Sec. 63 and 65, are <strong>not</strong> taken away.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Sec. 65B(1), further lays down that the <em>computer output</em> (copy) shall be “<em>deemed</em> to be <em><strong><span style="text-decoration:underline">ALSO</span></strong></em>” an (original) document, if the conditions in Sec. 65B(2) are satisfied, “notwithstanding anything contained in the Act”.
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>That is, Sec. 65B, does not bar proving a print/copy (as secondary evidence) by satisfying the conditions laid down in Sec. 65, by oral evidence or affidavit, as to loss of original, original with other side and notice given, original not easily movable, etc., as the case may be.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Sec. 65B deals with ‘<em><u>ADMISSIBILITY<strong>’</strong></u></em> of ‘<em><u>computer output’</u></em> (<em>derived from original</em>) alone.  </li>
<li>The conditions in Sec. 65B(2) (such as: computer was used regularly and operating properly, information was regularly fed into in the ordinary course) have to be satisfied by oral evidence or affidavit. In case of ‘statements’ alone, it can be had by the ‘certificate’ provided under Sec. 65B(4).</li>
<li>If the computer was one not used regularly, or the information was one not ‘regularly fed’ into the computer in the ordinary course, etc., Sec. 65B cannot be invoked (‘without further proof or production of the original’). E.g. photo or video captured in a mobile phone; ‘trap-video’. In such a case, we have to resort other provisions of the Evidence Act.</li>
</ol>
<p>In short, compliance of this enabling provision is not an invariable or imperative condition precedent to the admissibility’ of ‘computer output’ (<em>secondary evidence</em>); and it does not stand in the way of proving a secondary evidence of the contents of the ‘<em>electronic record</em>’, invoking the usual method laid down in Sec. 65 read with Sec. 63 of the Evidence Act – that is, satisfying the conditions laid down in Sec. 65, by oral evidence or affidavit.

<p><span style="text-decoration:underline"><strong>Presumption on ‘<u>Computer Output’</u> </strong>(print or copy)</span></p>
<p>From the very wordings in Sec. 65B(5)(c), the ‘proof’ (through witnesses or certificate) as to the involvement of the computer which (finally) produced the computer output (print or copy) need <strong>not</strong> be furnished. Because, the legislature contemplated a presumption as to correctness of the computer output (not truth of contents), under Sec. 65B(5)(c), as it reads:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>‘a computer output <mark class="has-inline-color has-primary-color" style="background-color:rgba(0,0,0,0)"><em><span style="text-decoration:underline">shall be </span><span style="text-decoration:underline">taken to have been</span></em></mark> produced by<span style="text-decoration:underline"> <strong><mark class="has-inline-color has-primary-color" style="background-color:rgba(0,0,0,0)">a</mark> </strong></span>computer whether it was produced by it directly or (<span style="text-decoration:underline">with or without human intervention</span>) by means of any appropriate equipment’.</li>
</ul>
<p>It is similar to Sec. 63 clause (2) which reads as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“Copies made from the original by <span style="text-decoration:underline">mechanical processes</span> <span style="text-decoration:underline">which in</span> <span style="text-decoration:underline">themselves</span> insure the accuracy of the copy …. …”</li>
</ul>
<p>Sec. 63 lays down the sorts of secondary evidence accepted by the Evidence Act. It is seen that Sec. 65B(5)(c) expressly says also as to presumption on correctness, as stated above.</p>
<p><strong><u>Mere marking– not dispense with proof</u></strong> <strong>(of truth of contents)</strong></p>
<p>In <strong>Sait Tarajee Khimchand v. Yelamarti Satyam</strong>, AIR 1971 SC 1865, the Supreme Court observed that mere marking of a documents (day book and ledger) as exhibits do not dispense with the proof of documents. In <strong>Nandkishore Lalbhai Mehta Vs. New Era Fabrics</strong>, AIR 2015 SC 3796, it is observed that mere marking as exhibit and identification of executor’s signature by one of witnesses does not prove contents of a document.</p>
<p>In <strong><em>Kaliya Vs. State of Madhya Pradesh</em></strong><em> (</em>2013-10 SCC 758) it is held as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“Mere admission of a document in evidence does not amount to its proof. Nor, mere marking of exhibit on a document does not dispense with its proof, which is otherwise required to be done in accordance with law. (Vide: The Roman Catholic Mission Vs.

Shaffi, AIR 2004 SC 4082; and LIC of India  Vs. Rampal Singh Bisen,2010-4 SCC 491).”</li>
<li>“The court is obliged to examine the <strong>probative value</strong> of documents produced in court or their contents and decide the question of admissibility of a document in secondary evidence.”</li>
<li>[Note: Further held: “In case, an objection is not raised at that point of time, it is precluded from being raised at a belated stage.”]</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><em>IF the TRUTH is IN ISSUE</em> </strong>mere proof of handwriting or execution not evidence of truth:   <em>IF the TRUTH of the facts stated in a document is IN ISSUE</em> mere proof of the hand-writing and execution of the document would not furnish evidence of the truth of the facts or contents of the document.</p>
<p>In <strong>Ramji Dayawala Vs. Invest Import</strong>: AIR 1981 SC 2085, it us held as under:</p>

</ul>
<p>If ‘truth’ is in issue, or in dispute, <em>marking without objection </em>by itself does not absolve the duty to prove the truth as to the contents of the documents.

<p><strong><u><strong><span style="text-decoration:underline">PART III – </span></strong> <span class="uppercase">Panditrao v. Kailash Kushanrao</span>, (2020)3 SCC 216: </u></strong></p>
<p>In the recent decision of our Supreme Court in <strong>Arjun Panditrao v. Kailash Kushanrao</strong><em>, substantially following <strong>Anvar v. Basheer </strong></em>[(2014)10 SCC 473] and overruling <strong><em>Shafhi Mohammad v. The State of Himachal </em></strong>[(2018)2 SCC 801], it is observed as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><em>“The deeming fiction is for the reason that “document” as defined by <strong>Section 3 of the Evidence Act does not include electronic records</strong>.”</em></li>
<li><em>“The non-obstante clause in sub-section (1) makes it clear that when it comes to information contained in an electronic record, admissibility and proof thereof must follow the drill of Section 65B, which is a special provision in this behalf – <strong>Sections 62 to 65 being irrelevant</strong> for this purpose.”</em></li>
<li>“However, Section 65B(1) clearly differentiates between the “original” document – which would be the original “electronic record” contained in the “computer” in which the original information is first stored – and the computer output containing such information, which then may be treated as evidence of the contents of the “original” document. All this necessarily shows that Section 65B differentiates between the original information contained in the “computer” itself and copies made therefrom – the former being primary evidence, and the latter being secondary evidence.”</li>
<li><em>“However, in cases where either a defective certificate is given, or in cases where such certificate has been demanded and is not given by the concerned person, <strong>the Judge conducting the trial must summon the person/persons</strong> referred to in Section 65B(4) of the Evidence Act, and require that such certificate be given by such person/persons.” </em></li>
<li>“<em>So long as the hearing in a trial is not yet over, the requisite <strong>certificate can be directed to be produced by the learned Judge at any stage,</strong> so that information contained in electronic record form can then be admitted, and relied upon in evidence.</em>” </li>
<li>“The …. required <strong>certificate under Section 65B(4) is unnecessary if the original document itself is produced</strong>. This can be done by the owner of a laptop computer, computer tablet or even a mobile phone, by stepping into the witness box and proving that the concerned device, on which the original information is first stored, is owned and/or operated by him.”</li>

<p><strong><span style="text-decoration:underline">Analysed</span></strong></p>
<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Re: Provisions in Sec. 63 and 65, are taken away or not: </strong>The Supreme Court, in Arjun Panditrao v. Kailash Kushanrao, (2020) 3 SCC 216, followed Anvar PV v. PK Basheer, (2014) 10 SCC 473, which held that Sections 65A and 65B constitute a complete code as to admissibility of electronic records.
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Therefore, it is laid down that Sections 63 and 65 of the Evidence Act cannot be invoked to prove a computer-output (print or copy derived from original); and</li>
<li>the drill of Section 65A and 65B should be invariably followed, and a computer-output can be proved only by the ‘Certificate’ provided under Sec. 65B(4) of the Evidence Act.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>It requires a re-look; because:
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>The other enabling provisions in the Indian Evidence Act to prove documents by secondary evidence, invoking Sec. 63 and 65, are <strong>not</strong> taken away by the new enabling provisions, Sec. 65A and 65B, as shown above.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Re: “statement”</strong>: Electronic record containing the statement” (e.g. call-records of phones, bank-account-statements) alone are dealt with in Sec. 65B(4) Certificate. (Contra view in Supreme Court decisions).
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>It does not pertain to ‘information’ like photo, video etc. in a computer, pen-drive or CD.</li>
<li>According to the Evidence Act, ‘statements’ are confined to the matters that can be made in a written form. [See: Sec. 3 (definition of ‘evidence’), Sec. 8 (Explanations), 32 to 39, 145, 157, and 158.]</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Re: ‘<em><u>admissibility’</u></em> and presumption of ‘<em><u>computer output</u></em></strong><em><u><strong>’</strong></u></em>: The intent of the legislature in enacting Sec. 65B was to specifically assign the principles as to presumption under Sec. 114 to the ‘computer output’, as far it considered possible. Section 65B deals with ‘<em><u>admissibility’</u></em> of <strong>‘</strong><em><u>computer output<strong>’</strong></u></em> (perceived as <em>secondary evidence</em>). Only formal evidence (and not truth of contents) is envisaged in Sec. 65B.<ul><li>Sec. 65B (1) states that the computer output shall be “admissible” ‘without further proof or production of the original, as evidence of any contents of the original or of any fact stated therein’ (if the conditions mentioned Sec. 65B(2) are satisfied).</li></ul>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>The requirement of condition as to ‘regularity’ of feeding information into the computer in the ‘ordinary course’ eloquently supports this proposition.</li>
<li>Though, generally, presumption of a ‘fact’ or ‘common/ordinary course’ under Sec. 114 Evd. Act is, essentially, presumption of ‘Truth’ (See: State of West Bengal v. Mir Mohammad Omar, AIR 2000 SC 2988) , it does not apply, here (in view of the wordings in Sec. 65B).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Re: Certificate:</strong> Certificate, swearing ‘best of the knowledge and belief’, cannot be brought by ‘force’ (as a ‘thing’).</li>
<li><strong>Re: Process of taking print or copy need not be Proved:</strong> From the very wordings in Sec. 65B, the ‘evidence’ (through witnesses or certificate) as to the involvement of the computer which (finally) produced the computer output (print or copy) need <strong>not</strong> be furnished.
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>The legislature contemplated a presumption as to correctness of the computer output (not truth of contents), under Sec. 65B (5)(c), as it reads: ‘a computer output shall be <em>taken to have been</em> produced by a computer whether it was produced by it directly or (with or without human intervention) by means of any appropriate equipment’.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Re: Whether <em>“document”</em> includes <em>electronic records’</em>:</strong> The observation in Arjun Panditrao that ‘the <em>deeming</em><em>fiction</em><strong><em> </em></strong>is for the reason that <em>“document”</em> as defined by Section 3 of the Evidence Act does not include <em>electronic records’</em> is not correct,
<ul class="wp-block-list">

<p class="has-small-font-size"><strong><u>What is ‘certificate’, in law</u></strong></p>
<ul class="has-small-font-size wp-block-list">
<li>The <span style="text-decoration:underline">usual</span> method to prove documents is by giving oral evidence or furnishing affidavit.  A certificate, in most cases, is an opinion, and prepared on the basis of other documents or evidences. In such cases, when it is an assumption or inference, it by itself, is not admissible, as it will only be, at the most, a secondary evidence. A Wound Certificate is not a substantive evidence. It has to be proved by a competent witness. If presumption cannot be invoked under Clause (e) of Sec. 114 Evidence Act (that judicial and official acts have been regularly performed), no certificate or report can be taken as proved unless its contents are proved in a formal manner. (This is why Order XXVI rule 10 CPC specifically says – Commission Report shall ‘form part of the record’.)</li>
<li>Our Apex Court held in Dharmarajan v. Valliammal, 2008 (2) SCC 741, that ‘a certificate issued by the Tahsildar cannot be relied on without examining the Tahsildar who issued the same’. It is referred to in Pankajakshan Nair v. Shylaja, ILR 2017-1 Ker 951.</li>

(supra), and incorrectly “clarified” in Shafhi Mohammed (supra).”</td><td>The non-obstante clause is given to provide an <strong><em>enabling</em></strong> provision to admit ‘computer output’   <em>(derived from original</em>)  as ‘document’ itself, in a simpler manner, by the <em>deeming</em> provision <strong>‘<em>notwithstanding anything </em></strong><em>contained in the Act</em>’. <br/><br/>The non-obstante clause is an <strong><em>enabling</em></strong> provision.

<p class="has-small-font-size"><strong><span style="text-decoration:underline"><span class="uppercase">Why the Non-obstante Clause </span>(The Entire Confusion Centers Round it)</span></strong></p>
<p class="has-small-font-size">The non-obstante clause is not to exclude Sec. 62 and 65. Because, on a combined reading of Section 65A and 65B it is clear that these provisions deal with evidence ‘derived  from original’  (computer output) alone; and not about original (electronic record). </p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Sec. 65B speaks: ‘Notwithstanding anything contained in the Act .. .. the <em>computer output</em> shall be <em><u>deemed</u></em> to be <em><u><strong>ALSO</strong></u></em> a document’ (if the conditions laid down are fulfilled).</li>
</ul>
<p class="has-small-font-size"><span style="text-decoration:underline">Sec. 65B is an enabling provision</span>. Sec. 65A and 65B do not bar proving <strong>(i) </strong>(original) ‘electronic records’ under Sec. 62 and <strong>(ii) </strong>computer outputs (derived from original ) under Sec. 65 (Sec. 65 provides for adducing secondary evidence if the original is lost, not easily movable etc.).  From Sec. 65A and 65B it is clear that Sec. 62 to 65 are independent from Sec. 65B (‘notwithstanding anything contained in the Act’); and, therefore,</p>
<ul class="has-small-font-size wp-block-list">
<li>Sec. 62 to 65 can also be invoked to prove ‘computer output’ (secondary evidence of the ‘electronic record’). That is, otherwise than by producing the Certificate under Sec. 65B(4).</li>
</ul>
<p class="has-small-font-size">It is held in State (NCT of Delhi) v. Navjot Sandhu,  (2005) 11 SCC 600, as under:</p>
<ul class="has-small-font-size wp-block-list">
<li>“Irrespective of the compliance with the requirements of Section 65-B, which is a provision dealing with admissibility of electronic records, there is no bar to adducing secondary evidence under the other provisions of the Evidence Act, namely, Sections 63 and 65.”(Contra view in Arjun Panditrao).</li>
</ul>
<p class="has-small-font-size">Assume, the competent person gives a ‘statement’ that he cannot vouchsafe as to the truth and veracity of the document, then what will be the next step? Or, what will be the position if that person gives a false statement with respect to the document (though he knows it to be true and genuine)? Further, if the circumstances or admission by the parties show it is a genuine copy and the competent person pretends ignorance as to the truth of the document, how it will be dealt with?</p>
<ul class="has-small-font-size wp-block-list">
<li>In all these circumstances, the ultimate way-out is to apply the principle accepted by Tomaso Bruno v. State of UP (and followed in Shafhi Muhammed – the overruled decision).</li>
