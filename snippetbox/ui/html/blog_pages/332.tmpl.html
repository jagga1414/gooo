<p><strong><span style="text-decoration:underline">Introduction</span></strong></p>
<p>In common parlance, the word ‘charity’ denotes the giving to someone in necessitous circumstances and in law, a giving for public good.<a href="#_ftn1" id="_ftnref1">[1]</a> Message of charily and compassion is found in all religions without any exception.<a href="#_ftn2" id="_ftnref2">[2]</a> An ‘endowment’ is created when a competent person dedicates or sets apart his specified property<a href="#_ftn3" id="_ftnref3">[3]</a> for purposes of religion or charity having both the subject and object certain and capable of ascertainment.<a href="#_ftn4" id="_ftnref4">[4]</a></p>
<p>In St. Peter’s Orthodox Syrian Church Vs. Abraham Mathews<a href="#_ftn5" id="_ftnref5">[5]</a> it is observed that if Indian life should be a true guide for the determination of questions arising in court, then we should go back to our ancient treatises to find out the true meaning of charity, which may be either dana or utsarga. It is observed further as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“In the case of dana the donor gives up his ownership over a thing, makes another the owner of it and cannot thereafter use it nor has any control over it. When a man makes an utsarga, he no doubt gives up his ownership but gives up the thing for the benefit of all. Opinion is, however, divided whether as a member of the public he can also use a thing thus dedicated for the public. But in any event, he would no longer have any control over the thing dedicated (Commissioner of Income Tax, New Delhi v. Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industries, New Delhi, AIR 1981 SC 1408). The word “Charity” in a legal sense includes every gift for the general public use, to be applied consistent with the existing laws for the benefit of an indefinite number of persons and intended to benefit them from a religious, moral, physical or social standpoint. (Pannalal Bansilal Pitti v. State of Andhra Pradesh, AIR 1996 SC 1023).”</li>
</ul>
<p>In Pratap  Singhji  Vs. Charity Commissioner<a href="#_ftn6" id="_ftnref6">[6]</a> our Apex Court held as followes:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“Under the Hindu law the image of a deity of the Hindu pantheon is, as has been aptly called, a ‘juristic entity’, vested with the capacity of receiving gifts and holding property. The Hindu law recognises dedications for the establishment of the image of a deity and for maintenance and worship thereof. The property so dedicated to a pious purpose is placed extra-commercium and is entitled to special protection at the hands of the Sovereign whose duty it is to intervene to prevent fraud and waste in dealing with religious endowments. Dedication need not always be in writing and can be inferred from the facts and circumstances appearing. It would be a legitimate inference to draw that the founder of the temple had dedicated it to the public if it is found that he had held out the temple to be a public one: Pujari Lakshmana Goundan V. Subramania Ayyar, AIR 1924 PC 44.”</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="text-decoration:underline">Law Commission Report</span></p>
<p>Law Commission of India, Report No. 70, The Transfer of Property Act, 1882, Forward to the Union Minister of Law and Justice, Ministry of Law and Justice, Government of India by P.B. Gajedragadkar, Chairman, Law Commission of India, on August 15, 1977, reads as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>“12.40. Rules of Hindu law</strong>. — It may be noted that in regard to religious offices and things dedicated to religious purposes, the rules of Hindu Law<sup>1</sup> and Muslim Law<sup>2</sup> agreed with that of the ancient Roman law in rigidly classifying public trusts and property and offices as <em>extra commorcium</em>. Such offices were not transferable like other property, and even where a transfer was allowed, that was within certain well defined limitations.</li>

</ul>
<p><strong><u>Essential Legal Formalities for Dedication</u></strong></p>
<p>The word ‘endow’<a href="#_ftn7" id="_ftnref7"><sup>[7]</sup></a> expresses the idea of giving, bequeathing or dedicating something for some purpose.<a href="#_ftn8" id="_ftnref8"><sup>[8]</sup></a> An ‘endowment’ is founded by dedication of property for the purposes of religion or charity having both the subject and object certain and capable of ascertainment. There may be dedication of property for ‘easement’. But, in the ‘law of trusts’, dedication involves the extinguishment of the rights of the original owner of the lands.<a href="#_ftn9" id="_ftnref9"><sup>[9]</sup></a> By ‘dedication’, the owner divests all his rights, title and interest in the property which becomes the property of the deity<a href="#_ftn10" id="_ftnref10"><sup>[10]</sup></a> or other endowment.</p>
<p>An ‘endowment’ can be public or private.<a href="#_ftn11" id="_ftnref11"><sup>[11]</sup></a> It is a corporeal reality to which social concepts are adhered to; whereas, a trust is primarily a legal conceptattached to the administration of the endowed property.<a href="#_ftn12" id="_ftnref12"><sup>[12]</sup></a></p>
<p>Dedication involves complete<a href="#_ftn13" id="_ftnref13">[13]</a> extinguishment of the rights, or cessation of ownership,<a href="#_ftn14" id="_ftnref14">[14]</a> of the original owner of the lands.<a href="#_ftn15" id="_ftnref15">[15]</a> The essential formalities for the creation of a religious or charitable endowment are:<a href="#_ftn16" id="_ftnref16">[16]</a></p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>the property in respect of which the endowment is made must be designated with precision;</li>
<li>the object or purpose of dedication should be clearly indicated;</li>
<li>the founder must effectively divest<a href="#_ftn17" id="_ftnref17"><u>[17]</u></a> himself of all beneficial interest (right of enjoyment as owner or beneficial ownership<a href="#_ftn18" id="_ftnref18">[18]</a>) in the endowed properly.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><u>Hindu Religious Formalities and Principles of Dedication</u></strong></p>
<p>Sankalpa and Utsarga (or Samarpana) are the religious formalities for dedication under Hindu Law.<a href="#_ftn19" id="_ftnref19">[19]</a> By Sankalpa one formally decides renunciation and indicates the purpose of dedication; and by Utsarga or Samarpana he renounces his ownership.  It is obvious that ‘Sankalpa and Samarpana’ are intrinsic, formally or informally, in all true dedications.</p>
<p>In Ram Jankijee Deities Vs. State of Bihar<a href="#_ftn20" id="_ftnref20">[20]</a> our Apex Court observed as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“The Deva Pratistha  Tatwa of Raghunandan and Matsya and Devi Puranas though may not be uniform in its description as to how Pratistha or consecration of image does take place but it is customary that the image is first carried to the Snan  Mandap and thereafter the founder utters the Sankalpa Mantra and upon completion thereof the image is given bath with Holy water, Ghee, Dahi, Honey and Rose water and thereafter the oblation to the sacred fire by which the Pran  Pratistha takes place and the eternal spirit is infused in that particular idol and the image is then taken to the temple itself and the same is thereafter formally dedicated to the deity. A simple piece of wood or stone may become the image or idol and divinity is attributed to the same. As noticed above, it is formless, shapeless but it is the human concept of a particular divine existence which gives it the shape, the size and the colour.”</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><u>Rule Against Perpetuity</u></strong></p>
<p>Section 18 of the Transfer of Property Act enacts that “the restrictions in Sections 14, 16 and 17 shall not apply in the case of a transfer of property for the benefit of the public in the advancement of religion, knowledge, commerce, health, safety or any other object beneficial to mankind”. The Hindu law has always regarded gifts for religious or charitable purposes as exempt from the rule against perpetuity.<a href="#_ftn21" id="_ftnref21">[21]</a></p>
<p><strong><u>Dedication to the Almighty</u></strong></p>
<p>The dedication to a deity is actually a renunciation of the ownership of the private individuals in the property. In effect, it is dedication to the Almighty. A Full Bench decision of Madras High Court said in the case of Narasimha Vs. Venkatalingam<a href="#_ftn22" id="_ftnref22">[22]</a> held that a gift to Almighty is not a gift to a living person and therefore, it is neither a gift nor a conveyance under the Transfer of Property Act. <a href="#_ftn23" id="_ftnref23">[23]</a>  </p>
<p><strong><u>Trust Arises on Transfer of Title to Trustees</u></strong></p>
<p>An endowment is created when a property is set apart or dedicated by its owner divesting all his beneficial interest (ie. pertaining to ownership) therein for the purposes of religion or charity having both the subject and object certain and capable of ascertainment.<a href="#_ftn24" id="_ftnref24">[24]</a> It is the relinquishment of entire rights of the donor or founder in the property dedicated;<a href="#_ftn25" id="_ftnref25">[25]</a> and, there should be proof of renunciation by the owner or divestment of his title to the property dedicated. <a href="#_ftn26" id="_ftnref26">[26]</a></p>
<p>For creation of a trust, it is essential that such property should be transferred to the trustee. The ingredients of trust stated in the former part of Section 6 (ie. intention, purpose, beneficiary and property), are the legal requirements for endowments also. ‘Transfer of the trust-property to the trustee’ is the differentiating particularity of trust from the endowment.</p>
<p>Sec. 6 of the Indian Trusts Act, 1882   reads as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“6. <span style="text-decoration:underline">Creation of trus</span>t: Subject to the provisions of section 5, a trust is created when the author of the trust indicates with reasonable certainty by any words or acts (a) an intention on his part to create thereby a trust, (b) the purpose of the trust, (c) the beneficiary, and (d) the trust-property, and (unless the trust is declared by will or the author of the trust is himself to be the trustee) transfers the trust-property to the trustee.”</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><u>No Document  is Essential for Dedication in Public Trust</u></strong></p>
<p>The act of delivering property, by its owner, for the use of the public is called ‘dedication’.</p>
<p>With regard to private trusts, under Sec. 5 of the Indian Trusts Act, for creation of trust on immovable property, ‘declaration by a non-testamentary instrument’ is essential; and for creation of trust on movable property, ‘transfer of ownership’ will be sufficient. </p>
<p>Sec. 5 of the Indian Trusts Act, 1882reads as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li> “5. <span style="text-decoration:underline">Trust of immovable </span>property: No trust in relation to immovable property is valid unless declared by a non-testamentary instrument in writing signed by the author of the trust or the trustee and registered, or by the will of the author of the trust or of the trustee.</li>
<li>Trust of movable property: No trust in relation to movable property is valid unless declared as aforesaid, or unless the ownership of the property is transferred to the trustee. ….”</li>
</ul>
<p>A public ‘endowment’ is created by dedication of property by a competent person.<a href="#_ftn27" id="_ftnref27">[27]</a> The subject and object of such dedication must be certain and capable of ascertainment. Trust arises by appointment of trustees to the endowments.<a href="#_ftn28" id="_ftnref28">[28]</a> Declaration by a registered deed transferring rights to trustee is the usual mode of creating trust on immovable property. But, a document is not essential for the dedication of property to charity or public trust.<a href="#_ftn29" id="_ftnref29">[29]</a>  It can be established by cogent and satisfactory evidence as to complete dedication and extinction of the private character of the property. Dedication can be inferred from conduct of the parties also.<a href="#_ftn30" id="_ftnref30">[30]</a></p>
<p>For a valid dedication, there should be proof of renunciation by the owner or divestment of his title to the property dedicated.<a href="#_ftn31" id="_ftnref31">[31]</a> A document is not essential for the dedication of property to charity.<a href="#_ftn32" id="_ftnref32">[32]</a>  It can be established by cogent and satisfactory evidence as to complete dedication to charity and extinction of the private secular character of the property. Dedication or divestiture of property can be established by attendant circumstances or conduct of the parties also.<a href="#_ftn33" id="_ftnref33">[33]</a></p>
<p>It had been held by the Privy Council in Hemanta Kumari Debi Vs. Gauri Shankar Tewari<a href="#_ftn34" id="_ftnref34">[34]</a> while dealing with a bathing ghat on the banks of the River Ganges, it was observed that in the absence of a formal and express endowment evidenced by deed or declaration, the character of the dedication can only be determined on the basis of the history of the institution and the conduct of the founder and his heirs.<a href="#_ftn35" id="_ftnref35">[35]</a><em></em></p>
<p><strong><u>If Document for Dedication, it Requires Registration</u></strong></p>
<p>Dedication of the property directly to the deity does not need compliance with the provisions of the Transfer of Property Act, there being no transfer of property to a ‘living person’ within the meaning of Section 5 of that Act.  If property is transferred by way of a gift to the trustee of a temple, it being one made to a living person, requirements of S. 123 of the Transfer of Property Act must be complied and the deed must be registered. <a href="#_ftn36" id="_ftnref36">[36]</a></p>
<p>The same view had been taken in Narasimhaswami Vs. Venkatalingam<a href="#_ftn37" id="_ftnref37">[37]</a> and it had been observed that though an idol is considered by a fiction of law as a juristic person clothed for some purposes with rights of persons, yet a juristic person is not a living person for the purpose of the Transfer of Property Act.</p>
<p><strong><u>Dedication and Section 9, TP Act</u></strong></p>
<p>Section 9 Transfer of Property Act states that a transfer of property may be made without writing in every case in which writing is not expressly required by law. TP Act does not require execution of a document when a property is dedicated for charity or for the use of the general public.  (See: Narsingdas Takhatmal v. Radhakisan Rambakas, (1952) 54 BomLR 492; Peddu Reddiar v. Kothanda Reddi, AIR 1966 Mad 419).</p>
<p>In Ramdas Chimna v. Pralhad Deorao, AIR 1965 Bom 74, it is held as follows:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“The relinquishment by Bainabai of her interest in the joint family property was merely abandonment of here interest in the joint family property in favour of her two sons. Such a relinquishment or abandonment of interest in the joint family property, even though it consists of immoveable properties and is of the value of Rs.100/- and upwards, can be effected without a written instrument, though if one is executed, it would undoubtedly require registration under Section 17 of the Registration Act, Gauri Bai v. Gaya Bai, AIR 1927 Nag. 44.”</li>
</ul>
<p>In The Weavers Mills Ltd. v.  Balkis Ammal, AIR 1969 Mad 462, it is observed, referring Sec. 9 as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“That section says that a transfer of property may be made without writing in every case in which a writing is not expressly required by law. The Transfer of Property Act is not exhaustive of the kind of transfers. We are inclined to agree with the proposition of Ramaswami J., in Sarandaya Pillai v. Sankarlinga Pillai 1959-2 Mad LJ 502 at p. 503 namely, that
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“the test, therefore, in this country to determine whether a transaction (be it a transfer or not) can be made without writing is to see if it is expressly required by law to be in writing. If the transaction is a ‘transfer of property’ and there is no express provision of law requiring it to be in writing. Section 9 will enable it to be made without writing. If on the other hand, the transaction is not a ‘transfer of property’ and there is no express provision of law requiring it to be in writing, the general principle referred to above will enable it to be validly made without writing.”</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The learned Judge, if we may say so with respect, rightly pointed out that Section 9 underlines the general principle that everything is to be taken permissible unless there is a prohibition against it and has been inserted in the statute ex abundanti cautela.”</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><u>Hindu Law on Dedication</u></strong></p>
<p>For a valid dedication there should be proof of renunciation of the ownership of (dedicated) property, by the owner.<a href="#_ftn38" id="_ftnref38">[38]</a> In case of a dispute as to dedication, the court decides the same on the basis of its particular facts and circumstances.<a href="#_ftn39" id="_ftnref39">[39]</a> The ceremonies of Sankalpa and Samarpana are relevant to show the intention of the owner. If there is clear evidence of divesting of ownership with the intention of devoting it to religious or charitable purpose, dedication can be inferred even without specific evidence of ceremonies.<a href="#_ftn40" id="_ftnref40">[40]</a></p>
<p>In Deoki  Nandan Vs. Murlidhar<a href="#_ftn41" id="_ftnref41">[41]</a> it is observed:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“It is a settled law that an endowment can validly be created in favour of an idol or temple without the performance of any particular ceremonies, provided the settlor has clearly and unambiguously expressed his intention in that behalf. Where it is proved that ceremonies were performed, that would be valuable evidence of endowment, but, absence of such proof would not be conclusive against it.” </li>
</ul>
<p>In Menakuru Dasaratharami Reddi Vs. D Subba Rao<a href="#_ftn42" id="_ftnref42">[42]</a> it is held:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“The principles of Hindu Law applicable to the consideration of questions of dedication of property to charity are well settled. Dedication to charity need not necessarily be by instrument or grant. It can be established by cogent and satisfactory evidence of conduct of the parties and use of the property which shows the extinction of the private secular character of the property and its complete dedication to charity.”</li>
</ul>
<p>In Kuldip Chand Vs. Advocate General to Government of H P<a href="#_ftn43" id="_ftnref43">[43]</a> while dealing with a Dharmasala, it is held:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“Dedication of property either may be complete or partial. When such dedication is complete, a public trust is created in contradistinction to a partial dedication which would only create a charity…… A dedication for public purposes and for the benefit of the general public would involve complete cessation of ownership on the part of the founder and vesting of the property for the religious object…. A dedication, it may bear repetition to state, would mean complete relinquishment of his right of ownership and proprietary.”</li>
</ul>
<p>It is pointed out by Dr. BK Mukherjea, J., on the Hindu Law of Religious and Charitable Trusts, Tagore Law Lectures, that ‘it is undoubtedly possible for a founder to dedicate property in the form of a gift; he can also, if he likes, create a trust through the medium of trustees’.<a href="#_ftn44" id="_ftnref44">[44]</a> </p>
<p>Mulla, Hindu Law: reads as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“A Hindu who wishes to establish a religious or charitable institution, may, according to his law, express his purpose and endow it. A trust is not required for that purpose. … “<a href="#_ftn45" id="_ftnref45">[45]</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Dr. BK Mukherjea, J. On Hindu Law of Religious and Charitable Trusts<a href="#_ftn46" id="_ftnref46">[46]</a> observes that a dedication by a Hindu for religious or charitable purposes is neither a ‘gift’ nor a ‘trust’ in the strict legal sense.</p>
<p>The Privy Council held in Vidya Varuthi Thirtha Vs Balusami Ayyar<a href="#_ftn47" id="_ftnref47">[47]</a> that a ‘trust’ in the sense in which the expression is used in English Law, is unknown in the Hindu system, pure and simple. Gift is made directly to idols, or images consecrated or installed in temples, or to a temple. Called by whatever name, the person attached to the administration is only the manager and custodian of the idol of the institution. The property is not conveyed to or vested in him. He is not a ‘trustee’ in the English sense of the term, although in view of the obligations and duties vesting on him, he is answerable as a trustee in the general sense, for maladministration.<a href="#_ftn48" id="_ftnref48">[48]</a></p>
<p>In the Mahomedan system also, the dedicated property is not conveyed to a the mutavalli. No property vests in him; and whatever property he holds is for the  institution. He holds it as manager with certain beneficial interest regulated by custom and usage.</p>
<p><strong><u>Dedication: Question of Fact</u></strong></p>
<p>Terms of the Document, if any, Important</p>
<p>Dedication is a question of fact which would have to be decided with reference to the terms of the document, if any. If the founders’ intention is clear from the document of foundation or other direct evidence, oral or documentary, no difficulty arises; and if there is no document or its language is ambiguous, or where the express dedication cannot be proved by positive evidence, it will be a matter for legal inference, legitimately drawn from the proved facts and attending circumstances of each case.<a href="#_ftn49" id="_ftnref49">[49]</a></p>
<p>In Baby Vs. Steward Co. Ltd<a href="#_ftn50" id="_ftnref50">[50]</a> the Kerala High Court observed interpreting the title deed under which the defendant Company, engaged in charity, obtained title, that though the title deed did not contain specific words as to the character of public trust, there was sufficient indication to suggest that a trust was intended to be created.</p>
<p>In Radhakanta Deb Vs. Commissioner of Hindu Religious Endowments, Orissa<a href="#_ftn51" id="_ftnref51">[51]</a> it is held:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“Where, however, a document is available to prove the nature and origin of the endowment and the recitals of the document show that the control and management of the temple is retained with the founder or his descendants, and that extensive properties are dedicated for the purpose of the maintenance of the temple belonging to the founder himself, this will be a conclusive proof to show that the endowment was of a private nature.”<a href="#_ftn52" id="_ftnref52">[52]</a></li>
</ul>
<p>In S. Shanmugam Pillai Vs.  K. Shanmugam Pillai<a href="#_ftn53" id="_ftnref53">[53]</a>  it is observed by the Supreme Court as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“Whether or not a dedication is complete would naturally be a question of fact to be determined in each case on the terms of the relevant document if the dedication in question was made under a document. .. “<a href="#_ftn54" id="_ftnref54">[54]</a></li>
</ul>
<p>In Kuldip Chand Vs. Advocate General to Government of HP<a href="#_ftn55" id="_ftnref55">[55]</a>  the Supreme Court has held that in absence of a formal and express endowment, the character of the dedication may have to be determined on the basis of the history of the institution and the conduct of the founder and his heirs. If the family of the donor retained the control over the property, a complete dedication cannot be inferred.</p>
<p>When a dedication to a charity is sought to be established in absence of an instrument or grant, it can be by oral evidence or by drawing inference from the conduct of the parties.<a href="#_ftn56" id="_ftnref56">[56]</a> The law requires that such dedication be established by cogent and satisfactory evidence of conduct of the parties and user of the property which show the extinction of the private secular character of the property and its complete dedication to charity.  In such a case the onus is heavy upon the party who sets-up dedication. It must be proved that the donor intended to divest himself of his ownership in the dedicated property. <a href="#_ftn57" id="_ftnref57">[57]</a></p>
<p><strong><u>‘Once a Dedication, Always Dedication’</u></strong></p>
<p>Dedication of property is like a rocket fired.  As long as it is in private realm it retains the character of a private property. <a href="#_ftn58" id="_ftnref58">[58]</a>  Once dedication is complete, it cannot be revoked. <a href="#_ftn59" id="_ftnref59">[59]</a> It is a trite law that ‘once a trust always a trust’.<a href="#_ftn60" id="_ftnref60">[60]</a>  In Shiromani Gurdwara Prabandhak Committee, Amritsar Vs. Som Nath Dass<a href="#_ftn61" id="_ftnref61">[61]</a> the Supreme Court has described ‘Endowment’ as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“Endowment is when donor parts with his property for it being used for a public purpose and its entrustment is to a person or group of person in trust for carrying out the objective of such entrustment. Once endowment is made, it is final and it is irrevocable. It is the onerous duty of the persons entrusted with such endowment, to carry out the objectives of this entrustment. They may appoint a manager in the absence of any indication in the trust or get it appointed through Court.”</li>
</ul>
<p>A dedication of property to a deity is irrevocable, and the rules, if any, laid down by the founder at the time of dedication regulating succession to the office of the shebait should be deemed to be irrevocable also unless the power of revocation is reserved by the grantor. The condition relating to the rule of succession of shebaitship forms an integral part of the dedication itself.<a href="#_ftn62" id="_ftnref62">[62]</a></p>
<p><strong><u>Trustees Cannot Remodel the Trust.</u></strong></p>
<p>In RP Kapur Vs. Kaushalya Educational Trust<a href="#_ftn63" id="_ftnref63">[63]</a> it is held by Delhi High Court (Avadh Behari Rohatgi) as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“The trustees can bring the trust to an end where there is power of dissolution, as in this case. But they cannot alter the purposes of the trust. They are not authorised by the trust instrument to remodel the trust. The trustees have no power to alter, amend or vary the trust purposes, whether on the ground of “expansion” or “addition” or “enlargement” of the objects of the trust. I decline to accept any suggestion that the trustees can alter a man’s intention because they think it beneficial to divert the trust property to charity. It seems to me: that is quite impossible. The reason is that a trust is an obligation, that is to say a tie of equity (viniculum juris), whereby the trustee accepts the confidence reposed in him by the author of the trust to hold or apply the trust property for the purposes of the trust.”</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><u>Fundamental Principles Cannot be Changed </u></strong><strong><u></u></strong></p>
<p>The fundamental principles upon which a trust is founded cannot be varied. Therefore, the courts cannot sanction any drastic amendment to the document of trust which would destroy the basic purpose for which the trust was created.</p>
<p>It is held in Pragji  Savji  Vaja  Vs.  Chhotalal  Narsidas  Parmar that no deviation from the object of the trust would be allowed; and that the properties would not be allowed to be sold to the members of the community for whose benefit the trust was created and the properties were acquired.<a href="#_ftn64" id="_ftnref64">[64]</a> This principle in Milligan Vs. Mitchel,<a href="#_ftn65" id="_ftnref65">[65]</a> Attorney General Vs. Anderson<a href="#_ftn66" id="_ftnref66">[66]</a> and Free Church of England Vs.

<p>House of Lords held in Free Church of England Vs. Overtoun<a href="#_ftn69" id="_ftnref69">[69]</a> (by a majority of 5-2) that the minority was entitled to the assets of the Free Church. It was observed that when men subscribe money for a particular object, and leave it behind them for the promotion of that object, their <em>successors have no right to change the object endowed</em>. It was held that, by adopting new standards of doctrine (and particularly by abandoning its commitment to ‘the establishment principle’, which was held to be fundamental to the Free Church), the majority had violated the conditions on which the property of the Free Church was held.</p>

<li>“Whether or not dedication is complete would naturally be a question of fact to be determined in each case in the light of the material terms used in the document. In such cases it is always a matter of ascertaining the true intention of the parties; it is obvious that such intention must be gathered on a fair and reasonable construction of the document considered as a whole. The use of the word “trust” or “trustee” is no doubt of some help in determining such intention; but the mere use of such words cannot be treated as decisive of the matter. The answer to the questions whether the private title over the property was intended to be completely extinguished or whether the title in regard to the property was intended to be completely transferred to the charity can be found not by concentrating on the significance of the use of the word “trustee” or “trust” alone but by gathering the true intent of the document considered as a whole. If the income of the property is substantially intended to be used for the purpose of the charity and only an insignificant and minor portion of it is allowed to be used for the maintenance of the worshipper or the manager, it may be possible to take the view that dedication is complete. If, on the other hand, for the maintenance of public charity a minor portion of the income is expected or required to be used and a substantial surplus is left in the hands of the manager or worshipper for his own private purposes, it would be difficult to accept theory of complete dedication. It is naturally difficult to lay down a general rule for the solution of the problem. Each case must be considered on its facts and the intention of the parties must be determined on reading the document as a whole.”</li>

<p><strong><u>Partial Dedication Creates ‘Charge’ Alone</u></strong></p>
<p>Complete dedication is essential for establishing a valid endowment, and partial dedication creates <strong><em>charge</em></strong> alone<strong>.<a href="#_ftn70" id="_ftnref70"><strong>[70]</strong></a></strong></p>
<p>In Menakuru  Dasaratharami  Reddi  Vs. D Subba  Rao<a href="#_ftn71" id="_ftnref71"><em><strong>[71]</strong></em></a>  it is held:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“Dedication of a property to religious or charitable purposes may be either complete or partial. If the dedication is complete, a trust in favour of Public Religious Charity is created.

<p><strong><u>Partial Dedication Creates Only ‘Charity’</u></strong></p>
<p>The Supreme Court held in Kuldip Chand Vs. Advocate General to Government of HP<a href="#_ftn72" id="_ftnref72">[72]</a>  that when such dedication was complete, a public trust was created in contra-distinction to a partial dedication which would only create a charity. <strong><u></u></strong></p>
<p><strong><u>Partially Dedicated or Charged Property – Alienable and Partible</u></strong></p>
<p>In MR Goda Rao Sahib Vs.  State of Madras<a href="#_ftn73" id="_ftnref73">[73]</a> it is held by our Apex Court that if the property is given out and out to an idol or to a religious or charitable institution and the donor divests himself of all beneficial interest (pertaining to ownership<a href="#_ftn74" id="_ftnref74">[74]</a>) in the property comprised in the endowment, the dedication is absolute; where the dedication is <em>partial,</em> a <em>charge</em> is created on the property or there is a trust to receive and apply a portion of the income for the religious or charitable purpose. In such a case, the property descends and is <em>alienable and partible</em> in the ordinary way, the only difference being that it passes with the charge upon it.<a href="#_ftn75" id="_ftnref75">[75]</a></p>
<p><strong><u>Dedication – Different Connotations</u></strong></p>
<p>‘Partial Dedication’ – Contradiction in Terms </p>
<p>Dedication is a word susceptible to different connotations.  The extreme view is that dedication is the act under which the owner of the property relinquishes his entire rights for the benefit of whole world<a href="#_ftn76" id="_ftnref76">[76]</a> or at least to a class thereof;<a href="#_ftn77" id="_ftnref77">[77]</a> and therefore, no question arises as to ‘partial dedication’ or to dedication for a family; because it would amount to contradiction in terms.  If this extreme view is accepted there would not be ‘dedication’ in private/family temple.</p>
<p>Dedication may be ‘Complete’ or ‘Partial’</p>
<p>Another view is that dedication can be ‘partial’ also. Dr. BK Mukherjea, J. ‘On Hindu Law of Religious &amp; Charitable Trusts’ observed as to absolute and partial Debutter thus:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“Where the dedication, made by a settlor in favour of an idol, covers the entire beneficial interest which he had in the property the Debutter is an absolute or complete Debutter. Where however, some proprietary or pecuniary right or interest in the property is either indisposed of or is reserved for the settlor’s family or relations, a case of partial dedication arises. In a partial dedication the deity does not become the owner of the dedicated property but is in the position of a charge holder in respect of the same.”<a href="#_ftn78" id="_ftnref78">[78]</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Our Courts laid down two different facets for ‘partial dedication’. </p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>(i) Partial dedication in favour of an existing endowment results in making a ‘charge’ over the property dedicated<a href="#_ftn79" id="_ftnref79">[79]</a> and it is liable to be alienated and partible.<a href="#_ftn80" id="_ftnref80">[80]</a></li>
<li>(ii) Partial dedication of property for the purpose of creation of an endowment gives rise to creation of a ‘charity’ alone.<a href="#_ftn81" id="_ftnref81">[81]</a></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="text-decoration:underline">‘Limited Dedication’ – Recognised in three different areas</span></p>
<p>First, to result in making a ‘charge’ over property whereby, in effect, no endowment as such is created.<a href="#_ftn82" id="_ftnref82">[82]</a>Secondly, in creation of a ‘charity’, as in the case of a Dharmasala.<a href="#_ftn83" id="_ftnref83">[83]</a>Thirdly, in establishment of a family/private temple, for the benefit of an ascertained group.<a href="#_ftn84" id="_ftnref84">[84]</a></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration:underline">Dedication without Trust</span></p>
<p>A Hindu can establish or endow a religious or charitable institution even without creating a trust. Mulla’s Hindu Law<a href="#_ftn85" id="_ftnref85">[85]</a> reads:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“A Hindu who wishes to establish a religious or charitable institution, may, according to his law, express his purpose and endow it. A trust is not required for that purpose. All that is necessary is that the religious or charitable purposes should be clearly specified, and that the property intended for the endowment should be set apart for or dedicated to those purposes….”<a href="#_ftn86" id="_ftnref86">[86]</a></li>
</ul>
<p><strong><u>Description of Property in a Deed – Not Conclusive</u></strong></p>
<p> Execution of a deed by itself will not prove dedication..  Though it is a piece of evidence, it is not conclusive for determining the dedication.  In Paras Nath Thakur Vs. Mohani Dasi Deceased Ana<a href="#_ftn87" id="_ftnref87">[87]</a> it is held that when a document is solemnly executed and registered, burden is heavy on the person who plead it to be fictitious. <a href="#_ftn88" id="_ftnref88">[88]</a></p>
<p>In M. Appala Ramanujacharyula Vs. M. Venkata-narasimha-charyulu<a href="#_ftn89" id="_ftnref89">[89]</a> that it was held by AP High Court that the mere execution of a deed of dedication without the donor intending to act upon the terms of the deed, would not create a valid endowment.<a href="#_ftn90" id="_ftnref90">[90]</a> In other words, to constitute a valid endowment, it must be established that the donor intended to divest himself of his ownership in the property dedicated.</p>
<p>Purchase of property in the name of deity is not <em>per se</em> evidence of dedication though it may be one of the circumstances.</p>
<p><strong><u>Long User and Dedication</u></strong></p>
<p>Long user of income from a land for support of an idol renders strong corroborative evidence of debutter and that by itself would not lead to an inference that dedication of the property in favour of the public was complete and absolute.   Instances of appropriation of property by a person to his own use for a long period will be a good evidence of his right; but, if instances are only recent or few and far between, it leads to inference as to abuse of trust. The endowment and its dedication will remain valid even if there is misappropriation or abuse of trust   by   the   trustees subsequent to a valid dedication.<a href="#_ftn91" id="_ftnref91">[91]</a></p>
<p><strong><u>Dedication Inferred From Long User As Wakf Property</u></strong><strong><u></u></strong></p>
<p>It is held by the Supreme Court in Syed Mohammad Salie Labbai Vs. Mohd Hanifa<a href="#_ftn92" id="_ftnref92">[92]</a>  that once a Kabarstan had been held to be a public graveyard then it vested in the public and constitutes a wakf and it could not be divested by nonuser but would always continue to be so whether it is used or not. The following rules were laid down by our Apex Court in order to determine whether a graveyard was a public or a private one:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“(1) That even though there may be no direct evidence of dedication to the public, it may be presumed to be a public graveyard by immemorial user i.e. where corpses of the members of the Mahomedan community have been buried in a particular graveyard for a large number of years without any objection from the owner. The fact that the owner permits such burials will not make any difference at all;</li>
<li>(2) that if the grave-yard is a private or a family graveyard then it should contain the graves of only the founder, the members of his family or his descendants and no others. Once even in a family graveyard members of the public are allowed to bury their dead, the private graveyard sheds its character and becomes a public graveyard;</li>
<li>(3) that in order to prove that a graveyard is public by dedication it must be shown by multiplying instances of the character, nature and extent of the burials from time to time. In other words, there should be evidence to show that a large number of members of the Mahomedan community had buried their corpses from time to time in the graveyard. Once this is proved, the Court will presume that the graveyard is a public one; and</li>
<li>(4) that where a burial ground is mentioned as a public graveyard in either a revenue or historical papers that would be a conclusive proof to show the public character of the graveyard.”</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><u>Is Trust  a ‘Living Person’ under S. 5 of the TP Act </u></strong></p>
<p>Can transfer of property be made to or by Trusts/Associations</p>
<p>Sec. 5 of the TP Act reads as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>5. “<span style="text-decoration:underline">Transfer of property” defined:</span>  In the following sections “transfer of property” means an act by which a living person conveys property, in present or in future, to one or more other living persons, or to himself and one or more other living persons; and “to transfer property” is to perform such act.</li>
<li>In this section “living person” includes a company or association or body of individuals, whether incorporated or not, but nothing herein contained shall affect any law for the time being in force relating to transfer of property to or by companies, associations or bodies of individuals.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">Existing Laws as to Transfer of Property, will Remain in Force</span></strong></p>
<p>Two points are emphasised in the 2<sup>nd</sup> paragraph of Sec. 5 –</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>First, all unregistered associations, whether incorporated or not, are ‘living persons’, so that transfer of property can be made.</li>
<li>Second, the qualifying <span style="text-decoration: underline">second limb</span> – ‘<em>nothing herein contained shall affect any law for the time being in force relating to transfer of property to or by companies, associations or bodies of individuals</em>‘ – <span style="text-decoration: underline">makes it clear</span>:
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>if any law regulates transfer of property to (or by) companies, associations or bodies of individuals, it will remain in force.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p> See also: Usha Rani Kundu  Vs. Agradut  Sangha<a href="#_ftn94" id="_ftnref94">[94]</a>.</p>
<p>It is now settled law that though an idol is considered by a fiction of law as a juristic person clothed for some purposes with rights of persons, it is not a living person for the purpose of the Transfer of Property Act.<a href="#_ftn95" id="_ftnref95">[95]</a></p>
<p>“<em><span style="text-decoration: underline">Body of individuals</span></em><span style="text-decoration: underline">” in Sec. 5, TP Act</span></p>
<p>It may also be pointed out that, “<em>body of individuals</em>” in Sec. 5, TP Act (transfer to – “living person” includes a company or association or <em>body of individuals</em>) is wide in meaning; and it stands independent. It is broad enough to take-in ‘beneficiaries’ of a Trust.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration:underline">Can ‘<em>Law for the Time Being in Force’</em> Include ‘Common Law’</span></p>
<p>‘Law for the time being in force’ in Sec. 5 TP Act includes “common law”.<a href="#_ftn96" id="_ftnref96">[96]</a> </p>
<p>It is a reality – the <em>common law</em> of our country accepts as valid the ‘transfer of property’ made to or effected by well-known institutions, organisations,<a href="#_ftn97" id="_ftnref97">[97]</a>and associations attached to well reputed trusts,<a href="#_ftn98" id="_ftnref98">[98]</a> institutions<a href="#_ftn99" id="_ftnref99">[99]</a> etc., though they are not juristic-persons in its strict sense<em>. </em>Our courts sumptuously refer to such deeds as documents executed by or in favour of such entities, when they are referred to as exhibits. For example:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Settlement deed by Ashramam–Swayam  Prakash  Ashramam Vs. G Anandavally  Amma : AIR  2010 SC 622;</li>
<li>Settlement to trust – S N Mathur  Vs. Board of Revenue: 2009-13  SCC 301;</li>

<li>Mortgage deed by a College – Sonar Bangla Bank Vs. Calcutta Engineering College:  AIR 1960 Cal 450.</li>
</ul>
<p>Similarly, the registration and revenue authorities, without objection, register deeds relating to such properties in the names of such institutions, associations etc.</p>
<p>It was held by our Apex Court in Kamaraju  Venkata Krishna Rao Vs. Sub Collector,  Ongole<a href="#_ftn100" id="_ftnref100">[100]</a> that, under Hindu Law, a tank can be an object of charity and when a dedication was made in favour of a tank, the same was considered as a charitable institution. Without deciding whether that institution can also be considered as a juristic person, it was held that the same had to be registered in its name (ie., in the name of the tank) in the Inam register though it had continue to be managed by its Manager.</p>
<p>It is also noteworthy that Salmond on Jurisprudence<a href="#_ftn101" id="_ftnref101">[101]</a> reads:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“Legal persons, being the arbitrary creations of the law, may be of as many kinds as the law pleases.”</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><u>Religious Trusts &amp; Gift to a ‘Non-existent Being’</u></strong></p>
<p>The Privy Council in Bhupathi  Nath Vs. Ramlal<a href="#_ftn102" id="_ftnref102">[102]</a>  settled the position that the law laid down in Tagore Vs. Tagore<a href="#_ftn103" id="_ftnref103">[103]</a> (a gift to a non-existent being is invalid) had no application to a religious trust, and held that such a gift to a would-be-installed deity would not be invalidated.</p>
<p><strong><u>Religious Trusts &amp; ‘Acceptance’ of Gift</u></strong></p>
<p> Though ‘acceptance’ is an integral part to take effect a gift in case of secular property, it is not material in religious gift or dedication.</p>
<p><strong><u>Religious Trusts: </u></strong><strong><u>Clear Directions for Management Not Necessary</u></strong></p>
<p>If a secular endowment is created with management under trustees, clear directions for management to the trustees are necessary; and it cannot be left to the discretion of a trustee, in which event a valid trust would not be created. If intention for dedication and setting apart of the property are proved, the form of religious gift is immaterial. </p>
<p>But, with respect to religious or charitable institutions, lack of details of entrustment may not invalidate the dedication. In the celebrated decision, Manohar   Ganesh Vs. Lakhmiram,<a href="#_ftn104" id="_ftnref104">[104]</a> it is held:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“A Hindu who wishes to establish a religious or charitable institution may, according to his law, express his purpose and endow it, and the ruler will give effect to the bounty or at least protect it so far, at any rate, as is consistent with his own dharma or conception of morality.”</li>
</ul>
<p>In Arjan Singh Vs. Deputy Mal Jain<a href="#_ftn105" id="_ftnref105">[105]</a> it is held:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“Dedication to purposes beneficial to the community are charities. ‘Gifts for charity are supported although no particular mode of carrying out the intention is prescribed’. (Tudor on Charities 5th ed. p. 133). If a trust was intended but there is no provision by the donor of machinery to carry his charitable purpose into effect the court supplies the omission. (Tudor on Charities 6th ed. p. 231).”</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><u>Hindu Law &amp; Roman Law – Vesting of Dedicated Property</u></strong></p>
<p>In Manohar Ganesh Vs. Lakhmiram<a href="#_ftn106" id="_ftnref106">[106]</a> West and Birdwood, JJ. held:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“The Hindu Law, like the Roman Law and those derived from it, recognises not only incorporate bodies with rights of property vested in the corporation apart from its individual members but also juridical persons called foundations. A Hindu who wishes to establish a religious or charitable institution may according to his law express his purpose and endow it and the ruler will give effect to the bounty or at least, protect it so far at any rate as is consistent with his own Dharma or conception of morality. A trust is not required for the purpose; the necessity of a trust in such a case is indeed a peculiarity and a modern peculiarity of the English Law. In early law a gift placed as it was expressed on the alter of God, sufficed it to convey to the Church the lands thus dedicated. It is consistent with the grants having been made to the juridical person symbolised or personified in the idol.”</li>
</ul>
<p>Dr. BK Mukherjea, J. enlightens us, in ‘On Hindu Law of Religious and Charitable Trusts’, referring to Manohar Ganesh Vs. Lakhmiram, as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“The religious institutions like mutts and other establishments obviously answer to the description of foundations in Roman Law. The idea is the same, namely, when property is dedicated for a particular purpose, the property itself upon which the purpose is impressed, is raised to the category of a juristic person so that the property which is dedicated would vest in the person so created. And so it has been held in Krishna Singh Vs. Mathura Ahir<a href="#_ftn107" id="_ftnref107">[107]</a> that a mutt is under the Hindu Law a juristic person in the same manner as a temple where an idol is installed.”<a href="#_ftn108" id="_ftnref108">[108]</a></li>
</ul>
<p><strong><u>Hindu Law: Dedication Otherwise than ‘Complete Relinquishment’</u></strong></p>
<p>While dealing with a Bathing <em>Ghat</em> on the banks of the River Ganges, pointing out peculiarities of Hindu Law,  it is observed by the Privy Council in <em>Hemanta  Kumari Debi Vs. Gauri Shankar Tewari</em><a href="#_ftn109" id="_ftnref109"><em><strong>[109]</strong></em></a><em> </em>that complete relinquishment of title was not the only form of dedication under Hindu Law.<a href="#_ftn110" id="_ftnref110">[110]</a> It observed:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“Complete relinquishment by the owner of his proprietary right is however by no means the only form of dedication known to the Hindu law and is very different from anything that could ordinarily be inferred from the public user of a highway. From the standpoint of the Hindu law ‘it is not essential to a valid dedication that the legal title should pass from the owner nor is it inconsistent with an effectual dedication that the owner should continue to make any and all uses of the land which do not interfere with the uses for which it is dedicated.’ The Chairman, Hawrah Municipality Vs.  Khetra  Kristo  Mitter (1906) 10 C.W.N. 1044, S.C. 4 C.L.J. 343, (per Mookerjee J., at p. 348).”<a href="#_ftn111" id="_ftnref111">[111]</a></li>
</ul>
<p><strong><u>If Valid Dedication, No Change of Character, On Regn. as Socieety</u></strong></p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“Any addition to those properties must also have the same character.”</li>
</ul>
<p>As stated above, normally, the property acquired by a society does not part-take the character of ‘public purpose’ stated in Sec. 92 CPC. (Keshava Panicker Vs. Damodara Panicker AIR 1976 Ker 86; C Chikka Venkatappa Vs. D Hanumanthappa 1970 (1) Mys LJ 296) .But, if a charitable or religious institution of a public nature (Eg. A temple or a math or Guru Granth Sahib, revered in a Gurudwara) is expressly or constructively founded by an ascertainable number of persons or an association, by valid dedication of properties acquired by the members or society, it will accomplish the character of ‘public purpose’ stated in Sec. 92 CPC. </p>
<p>Subsequent registration of an association involved in a trust, under the Societies Registration Act, will not make any change to the trust character of the properties dedicated.  Kesava Panicker Vs. Damodara Panicker (AIR 1976 Ker 86) was a case where the entire community in a particular area took an active interest and contributed funds for the purpose of creating ‘a trust fund’ for establishing a school. A committee was formed for collecting funds. Utilising that fund the school building was constructed. Subsequently a society was formed and registered under the Societies Registration Act for the purpose of management of the school. A question arose whether the character of the properties would be changed by the formation of the society. The Full Bench of the Kerala High Court held as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“If there was a trust created by the public, for a public charitable purpose namely establishing, maintaining and running a school, the fact of the registration of a society could not change the character of the properties which had already been constituted as trust properties and impressed with the trust and any addition to those properties must also have the same character.”</li>
</ul>
<p>We can take cue from Achuthan Nair v. Chinnammu Amma, AIR 1966 SC 411, where their Lordships said the following as to the addition of property acquired from the joint-family-nucleus-</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“Under Hindu Law, when a property stands in the name of a member of a joint family, it is incumbent upon those asserting that it is a joint family property to establish it. When it is proved or admitted that a family possessed sufficient <span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>nucleus</strong> with the aid of which the member might have made the acquisition</span>, the law raises a presumption that it is a joint family property and the <span style="text-decoration: underline">onus is shifted to the individual member to establish</span> that the property was acquired by him <span style="text-decoration: underline">without the aid of the said <strong>nucleus</strong></span>. This is a well settled proposition of law. But the principle is not applied to acquisition of properties in the name of a junior member of a tarwad (anandravan) under the Marumakkathayyam law. There is no presumption either way and the question has to be decided on the facts of each case. In the case of a property acquired in the name of the karnavan, however, there is a tarwad property and the presumption holds good unless and until it is rebutted by acceptable evidence….”  </li>

<p><strong><u>Gift on Trust to a Society</u></strong></p>
<p>If property is gifted to a registered society on condition that the property should be used for public purposes and casted duties on the society to act as trustee, a trust is brought home.<a href="#_ftn112" id="_ftnref112">[112]</a></p>
<p><strong><u>An Association Cannot Claim Rights Over the Property of a Trust</u></strong></p>
<p>In Church of North India Vs. Lavajibhai  Ratanjibhai<a href="https://indianlawlive.net/2021/05/30/incidents-of-trust-in-clubs-and-societies/#_ftn95"></a> (AIR 2005 SC 2544) it is held that an association of persons cannot claim rights over the property of a trust, if the property had already been vested in the trust.</p>
<p>Brief facts:</p>
<p>The Church, FCDB, was a registered religious society.  This Church and other 6 Churches resolved to dissolve; and consolidate into a single entity, The Church of Northern India (CNI). The ‘CNI Trust Association’ was subsequently formed under the Companies Act and was appointed as the trustee of the CNI. Defendants 1 to 4 (though given consent to unification proceedings, earlier) obstructed the functioning of the CNI and asserted their independent right to hold all the movable and immovable properties of their congregation (Valsad Brethren Church) and took the stand that there was no resolution for ‘dissolution’ as set out in the So. Regn. Act.</p>
<p>During the pendency of the suit, unification was ‘given effect to’ by the Charity Commr. under the BPT Act.  The plaintiffs filed the suit to declare ‘that the former FDCB has ceased to exist’ and ‘that the CNI is the legal continuation and successor of the FDCB …’ etc. The Civil Court may have jurisdiction over a matter which is outside the purview of the Act, or over a question arises in relation to a matter unconnected with the administration or possession of the trust property.</p>
<p>The effect of ‘dissolving’ a registered society (FDCB) by taking resolution ‘for unification’ with other associations (Churches) to form a single entity (CNI) was placed for consideration of our Apex Court several times. Besides, this decision (Lavajibhai Ratanjibhai), Vinodkumar M. Malavia Vs. Maganlal Mangaldas Gameti<a href="https://indianlawlive.net/2021/05/30/incidents-of-trust-in-clubs-and-societies/#_ftn96"></a> [(2013) 15 SCC 394] is important among them. The dismissal of the suit was upheld by our Apex Court holding that the civil court had no jurisdiction where bar is imposed in relation to a matter whereover the statutory authorities (under BPT Act) have the requisite jurisdiction and that a society created under a statute must conform to its provisions and the courts would interfere in case of its violation.</p>

</ul>
<p>It was observed, inter alia, in this land-mark decision (Church of North India Vs. Lavajibhai Ratanjibhai),rendered by SB Sinha, J:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“In terms of Section 5 of the Societies Registration Act, all properties would vest in the trustees, and <span style="text-decoration: underline">only in case in the absence of vesting of such properties in the trustees</span> would the same be <span style="text-decoration: underline">deemed to have been vested </span>for the time being <span style="text-decoration: underline">in the governing body</span> of such property. In this case, it is clear that the <span style="text-decoration: underline">properties have vested in the trustees and not in the governing body of the society</span>.” (Para 60)</li>
<li>“Unless a suit is filed in terms of Section 13 of the Act, the society is not dissolved.” (Para 64)</li>
<li>“Concededly, the properties of the trust being properties of the religious trust had vested in such trust.” (Para 64)</li>
<li>“If the properties of the churches did not belong to the society, the appellant herein cannot claim the same as their successor.” (Para 64)</li>
<li>“Even if it is contended that the administration of the property would mean the properties of the Brethren church both as a trust and as a society, still then having regard to the legal position, as discussed supra, <span style="text-decoration: underline">the property belonging exclusively to the trust</span>, the <span style="text-decoration: underline">suit will not be maintainable</span> (by virtue of the provisions of the BPTA).” (Para 64)</li>
</ul>
<p>It is observed in Vinodkumar M. MalaviaVs. Maganlal Mangaldas Gameti, (2013) 15 SCC 394, a under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“The argument that as per Article 254 of the Constitution, the Societies Registration Act overrides the BPTA or that the Societies Registration Act and BPTA are in conflict, does not stand either, since both the statutes are not in conflict with each other. On the contrary, they are in <em>consonance with eac</em>h other regarding the administration and regulation of public and religious trusts.”</li>
<li>“The High Court has rightly observed that: ‘… The trust which has been created as public trust for a specific object and the charitable or the religious nature or for the bonafide of the Society or any such institution managed by such trusts for <span style="text-decoration: underline">charitable and religious purpose shall continue to exist in perpetuity</span> and it <span style="text-decoration: underline">would not cease to exist</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline">by </span>any such process of thinking or deliberation or the <span style="text-decoration: underline">Resolution</span>, which does not have any force of law’.”</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><u>Founding Endowment by Subscriptions or Donations</u></strong></p>
<p>Where a person collects subscriptions from various persons and builds a choultry or a temple he has a right to direct in what manner the institution should be managed and what right the trustees should have in the management of that institution. This is recognised by the Hindu Law. There is nothing illegal or improper in a person who builds a temple whether out of his own funds or out of the funds collected by subscriptions<a href="#_ftn113" id="_ftnref113">[113]</a> or getting donations from people to create a trust and endow it, directing by the deed of endowment, in what manner and by whom it should be managed.<a href="#_ftn114" id="_ftnref114">[114]</a> If a number of persons provide the original endowment, they may apparently together constitute the founder.<a href="#_ftn115" id="_ftnref115">[115]</a></p>
<p>In Attorney-General V/s. Clapham<a href="#_ftn116" id="_ftnref116">[116]</a> Lord Cranworth, Lord Chancellor observed as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“Where a fund is raised for a charitable purpose like that of founding a chapel and the contributors are so numerous as to preclude the possibility of their all concurring in any instrument declaring the trusts, but such a declaration is made by the persons in whom the property is vested, at or about the time when the sums have been raised, that declaration may reasonably be taken prima facie as a true exposition of the minds of the contributors. The presumption is, that the trusts declared were those which the contributors intended. It would be open to them, if the trusts were not so framed as to effect the object they had in view, to take steps for getting any errors corrected. If no such steps are taken, it must be assumed that the instrument declaring the trusts fairly embodies the intentions of the contributors.”<a href="#_ftn117" id="_ftnref117">[117]</a></li>
</ul>
<p>In Thenappa Chettiar Vs. Karuppan Chettiar<a href="#_ftn118" id="_ftnref118">[118]</a> it is held: </p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“It is not a correct proposition of law to state that every donor contributing at the time of foundation of a trust becomes a founder of the trust. It may be that in a particular case all the contributors of a trust fund become the founders of the trust itself’ but the question when a contributor would become in law a joint founder of the trust would depend not merely upon the fact of his contribution but also upon the surrounding circumstances proved in the particular case and the subsequent conduct of the parties.”</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><u>Entries in Revenue Records and Proof of Dedication</u></strong></p>
<p>Following propositions are relevant in the matter of dedication of property of an endowment:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>(i)    If dedication or its nature (private or public) is convincingly proved, revenue records will not displace such proof.<a href="#_ftn119" id="_ftnref119">[119]</a></li>
<li>(ii)   Revenue Records are not documents of title.</li>
<li>(iii)  Revenue Records raise presumption alone; that too, rebuttable.</li>
<li>(iv)  When no other evidence is forthcoming, it is a valuable piece of evidence. Sec. 35 and 114 Evidence Act are attracted.<a href="#_ftn120" id="_ftnref120">[120]</a></li>
<li>(v)  Where a statute (eg. Land Revenue Acts of certain States) confers presumption to a Revenue entry, it must be considered.<a href="#_ftn121" id="_ftnref121">[121]</a></li>
</ul>
<p>It is held by our Apex Court in Syed Mohammad Salie Labbai Vs. Mohd Hanifa<a href="#_ftn122" id="_ftnref122">[122]</a>  that where a burial ground is mentioned as a public graveyard in either a revenue or historical papers, that would be a conclusive proof to show the public character of the graveyard. In Shamshuddin Vs. State of U P<a href="#_ftn123" id="_ftnref123">[123]</a> it is held by the Allahabad High Court with respect to Revenue Entry as to a graveyard, as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“On the aforesaid discussion, the Court finds that a graveyard once dedicated as such will always remain a graveyard even no traces of dead may be found. … The revenue records may not prove such dedication, but that once it is proved that the dedication is complete, the entries of such land in the revenue records, in favour of the owner of the land would not take away or write off effect of such dedication.”</li>
</ul>
<p>In Narayana Prasad Agarwal Vs.  State of MP<a href="#_ftn124" id="_ftnref124">[124]</a> it is laid down as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“Record of right is not a document of title. Entries made therein in terms of Section 35 of the Indian Evidence Act although are admissible as a relevant piece of evidence and although the same may also carry a presumption of correctness, but it is beyond any doubt or dispute that such a presumption is rebuttable.”</li>
</ul>
<p>In Poohari Fakir Sadavarthy of BondilipuramVs.  Commr., Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments<a href="#_ftn125" id="_ftnref125">[125]</a> it was observed:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“The observations of the Privy Council in Arunachellam’s case that in the absence of the original grant the Inam Register is of great evidentiary value, does not mean that the entry or entries in any particular column or columns be accepted at their face value without giving due consideration to other matters recorded in the entry itself.” <a href="#_ftn126" id="_ftnref126">[126]</a></li>
</ul>
<p>In Kuldip Chand Vs. AG Government of HP<a href="#_ftn127" id="_ftnref127">[127]</a> the Supreme Court held that had a dedication been made, the same was expected to be recorded in the revenue records; and that in terms of Section 35 of the Evidence Act, the entries in the revenues record would be presumed to be correct, although the same was a rebuttable one. It is also held by our Apex Court in Sukhdev Singh Vs.  Maharaja Bahadur<a href="#_ftn128" id="_ftnref128">[128]</a> that ‘when a party to the suit had not been able by clear and conclusive evidence to rebut the presumption arising from the Record of Rights and the record of Permanent Settlement and he had failed to establish his claim’, the entries in Revenue Records could be relied upon.</p>
<p>In Gurunath  Manohar  Pavaskar  Vs.  Nagesh  Siddappa  Navalgund<a href="#_ftn129" id="_ftnref129">[129]</a> after quoting Narayana Prasad Agarwal Vs.  State of MP<a href="#_ftn130" id="_ftnref130">[130]</a> it is held:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“A revenue record is not a document of title. It merely raises a presumption in regard to possession. Presumption of possession and/or continuity thereof both forward and backward can also be raised under Section 110 of the Indian Evidence Act.”</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><u>Revenue Records in the Name of Deity not Decisive</u></strong></p>
<p>Even if the ownership of property is set-down in revenue records in the name of Deity, it is not treated as inconsistent with its private ownership.</p>
