<p><strong><u>Abstract</u></strong></p>
<p>The proposed Bhartiya Sakshya Act, 2023 introduces significant changes as regards ‘Electronic Evidence’. It updates Sec. 65B .</p>
<p>One of the key requirements of the new Act is production of a ‘HASH’ certificate, to prove the copy or print-out (<em>computer output</em>). It is seen introduced with a view to avert tampering. But it appears that this requirement is harsh and unwanted. </p>
<p><strong><u>What are the Major Changes made</u></strong> <strong><u>in Sec. 65B IEA?</u></strong></p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Now, under Sec. 65B of the Indian Evidence Act, copy or print-out of an <em><u>electronic record</u></em> can be proved only by producing the certificate provided under Sec. 65B(4).  </li>
<li>The proposed Bhartiya Sakshya Act, 2023, allows to prove the copy or print-out of an <em><u>electronic record</u></em> invoking other provisions of the Evidence Act (such as Sec. 63 and 65 IEA = Sec. 58 and 60 BSA) that permits to prove a secondary evidence (copy) of a document.</li>
<li>If an <em><u>electronic record</u></em> is sought to be proved invoking Sec. 63, Bhartiya Sakshya Act, 2023, “the <span style="text-decoration: underline">certificate specified in the Schedule</span>” is necessary. It is to be produced “along with the electronic record”.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><u>Other Major Changes in this regard, in the New Act</u></strong></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline">First</span> – The existing Evidence Act contains three explanations alone while escribing ‘Primary Evidence’ in Sec. 62. </p>
<p>Explanation 4, 5, 6 and 7 are added in the new Sakshya Act, in the Sec. 57. It reads as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“57. <span style="text-decoration: underline">Primary evidence</span></li>
<li>Primary evidence means the document itself produced for the inspection of the Court.</li>
<li>Explanation 1.—Where a document is executed in several parts, each part is primary evidence of the document.</li>
<li>Explanation 2.—Where a document is executed in counterpart, each counterpart being executed by one or some of the parties only, each counterpart is primary evidence as against the parties executing it.</li>
<li>Explanation 3.—Where a number of documents are all made by one uniform process, as in the case of printing, lithography or photography, each is primary evidence of the contents of the rest; but, where they are all copies of a common original, they are not primary evidence of the contents of the original.</li>
<li><strong>Explanation 4.—Where an electronic or digital record is created or stored, and such storage occurs simultaneously or sequentially in multiple files, each such file is primary evidence. </strong></li>
<li><strong>Explanation 5.—Where an electronic or digital record is produced from proper custody, such electronic and digital record is primary evidence unless it is disputed.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Explanation 6.—Where a video recording is simultaneously stored in electronic form and transmitted or broadcast or transferred to another, each of the stored recordings is primary evidence. </strong></li>
<li><strong>Explanation 7.—Where an electronic or digital record is stored in multiple storage spaces in a computer resource, each such automated storage, including temporary files, is primary evidence.”</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>From Explanations 4, 5, 6 and 7 it is clear that the scope of primary evidence is widened.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline">Second</span> – A new provision is made – Sec. 61, which stipulates that –</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“61. <span style="text-decoration: underline">Electronic or digital record</span> – Nothing in this Adhiniyam shall apply to deny the admissibility of an electronic or digital record in the evidence on the ground that it is an electronic or digital record and such record shall, subject to section 63, have the same legal effect, validity and enforceability as other document.”</li>
</ul>
<p>The words “<span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>nothing</strong> in this Adhiniyam <strong>shall apply</strong> to <strong>deny the admissibility</strong></span>” in Sec. 61 are also made to expand the scope of admissibility of Electronic Evidence. The non-obstante clause in Sec. 65B is capable of giving two (divergent) interpretations –</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>First, Sec. 65B is an <strong><em>enabling</em></strong> provision to admit ‘computer output’ <em>(derived from original</em>)  as ‘document’ itself, in a simpler manner, by the <em><span style="text-decoration: underline">deeming</span></em> provision (“shall be deemed to be <strong>also</strong> a document”) <strong>‘<em>notwithstanding anything </em></strong><em>contained in the Act</em>’. That is, computer output (copy) can <strong>also</strong> be proved by any other manner provided for proving any other document.</li>
<li>Second, a computer output (copy) can be proved <span style="text-decoration: underline">only under</span> the provisions of Sec. 65 B, <strong>‘<em>notwithstanding anything </em></strong><em>contained in the Act</em>’. (It is the view taken by the Supreme Court in Arjun Panditrao v. Kailash Kushanrao, (2020)3 SCC 216.)</li>
</ul>
<p>The words in the new Section 61,  “<span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Nothing</strong></span> in this Adhiniyam <span style="text-decoration: underline"><em>shall apply</em></span> <span style="text-decoration: underline">to <strong>deny</strong> <strong>the admissibility</strong></span>” has great significance. It is an emphatic delineation of the legislative intent on the following two matters –</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>1. Sec. 65B is an <strong><em>enabling</em></strong> provision to admit ‘computer output’ <em>(copy</em>)  as a ‘document’ itself, in a simpler manner, by the <em><span style="text-decoration: underline">deeming</span></em> provision    <strong>‘<em>notwithstanding anything </em></strong><em>contained in the Act</em>’, as stated above. </li>
<li>2. The interpretation given to Sec. 65B that a ‘computer output (copy) can be proved only’ under the provisions of Sec. 65 B, <strong> ‘<em>notwithstanding anything </em></strong><em>contained in the Act</em>’, is not accepted by the legislature (that is the view taken by the Supreme Court in Arjun Panditrao v. Kailash Kushanrao, (2020)3 SCC 216.) 
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>The the words, “subject to section 63” in  Section 61, only directs to undergo the requirements in Sec. 65B (that is production of Sec. 65B(4) certificate, and HASH certificate) to prove the Computer output, in case (or, only when) one opts to prove it under the provisions of Sec. 65B. </li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline">Note:</span> If this interpretation is not given Sec. 61 stands meaningless.</p>
<p><strong><u>Methods to Prove Secondary Evidence (copy) in the BSA</u></strong></p>
<p><strong><u>A Discordant Note</u></strong></p>
<p>The Certificate required in Sec. 63(4)(c) of the new Act must be “in the form specified in the Schedule”. It appears that this certificate is needed in addition to the Certificate that is required in sub-section (4) as regards the matters enumerated therein; or the Certificate should contain (additionally) the matters enumerated in sub-section (4).</p>
<p>The Form in the Schedule directs to state as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“I state that the HASH value/s of the electronic/digital record/s is …… ……… …… , obtained through the following algorithm –</li>
<li>SHA1:</li>
<li>SHA256:</li>
<li>MD5:</li>
<li>Other …….. …….. …….. (Legally acceptable standard)</li>
<li>(Hash report to be enclosed with the certificate)”</li>
</ul>
<p>The requirement for this certificate is unnecessary, especially in situations where there is no dispute regarding the computer output (copy or print-out). It may be more feasible for many litigants to bring the original device, such as a computer, laptop, or mobile phone, to court than to get the HASH value fixed through an expert.</p>
<p><strong><u>END NOTE – 1</u></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">What is HASH value</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline">(in simplest terms)</span>?</strong></p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>HASH value is a string of unique characters, usually represented by letters and numbers.</li>
<li>It is a scientific method (algorithm) commonly used to find out tampering, if any, on an electronic record.</li>
<li>HASH value of every electronic record can be fixed. </li>
<li>Any modification or change made thereto – no matter how small, even addition of a comma (,) – will result in a completely different hash value.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><u>END NOTE – 2</u></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">Sections 58 to 63 of BSA read as under:</span></strong> </p>
<p>58. <strong><u>Secondary evidence</u></strong> – Secondary evidence includes—</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>(1) certified copies given under the provisions hereinafter contained;</li>
<li>(2) copies made from the original by mechanical processes which in themselves ensure the accuracy of the copy, and copies compared with such copies;</li>
<li>(3) copies made from or compared with the original;</li>
<li>(4) counterparts of documents as against the parties who did not execute them;</li>
<li>(5) oral accounts of the contents of a document given by some person who has himself seen it;</li>
<li>(6) oral admissions;</li>
<li>(7) written admissions;</li>
<li>(8) evidence of a person who has examined a document, the original of which consists of numerous accounts or other documents which cannot conveniently be examined in Court, and who is skilled in the examination of such documents.</li>
</ul>
<p>Illustration.</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>(a) A photograph of an original is secondary evidence of its contents, though the two have not been compared, if it is proved that the thing photographed was the original.</li>
<li>(b) A copy compared with a copy of a letter made by a copying machine is secondary evidence of the contents of the letter, if it is shown that the copy made by the copying machine was made from the original.</li>
<li>(c) A copy transcribed from a copy, but afterwards compared with the original, is secondary evidence; but the copy not so compared is not secondary evidence of the original, although the copy from which it was transcribed was compared with the original.</li>
<li>(d) Neither an oral account of a copy compared with the original, nor an oral account of a photograph or machine-copy of the original, is secondary evidence of the original.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>59. <u>Proof of documents by primary evidence</u></strong> – Documents shall be proved by primary evidence except in the cases hereinafter mentioned.</p>
<p><strong>60. <u>Cases in which Secondary Evidence relating to documents may be given</u></strong> – Secondary evidence may be given of the existence, condition, or contents of a document in the following cases, namely: —</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>(a) when the original is shown or appears to be in the possession or power—
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>(i) of the person against whom the document is sought to be proved; or</li>
<li>(ii) of any person out of reach of, or not subject to, the process of the Court; or</li>
<li>(iii) of any person legally bound to produce it, and when, after the notice mentioned in section 64 such person does not produce it;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>(b) when the existence, condition or contents of the original have been proved to be admitted in writing by the person against whom it is proved or by his representative in interest;</li>
<li>(c) when the original has been destroyed or lost, or when the party offering evidence of its contents cannot, for any other reason not arising from his own default or neglect, produce it in reasonable time;</li>
<li>(d) when the original is of such a nature as not to be easily movable;</li>
<li>(e) when the original is a public document within the meaning of section 74;</li>
<li>(f) when the original is a document of which a certified copy is permitted by this Adhiniyam, or by any other law in force in India to be given in evidence;</li>
<li>(g) when the originals consist of numerous accounts or other documents which cannot conveniently be examined in Court, and the fact to be proved is the general result of the whole collection;(h) when the genuineness of the document itself is in question.</li>
</ul>
<p>Explanation.—For the purposes of,—</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>(i) clauses (a), (c) and (d), any secondary evidence of the contents of the document is admissible;</li>
<li>(ii) clause (b), the written admission is admissible;</li>

<li>(iv) clause (g), evidence may be given as to the general result of the documents by any person who has examined them, and who is skilled in the examination of such documents.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>61. <u>Admissibility of electronic or digital record</u></strong> – Nothing in the Adhiniyam shall apply to deny the admissibility of an electronic or digital record in the evidence on the ground that it is an electronic or digital record and such record shall have the same legal effect, validity and enforceability as paper records.</p>
