<p><strong><u>Plaintiff has to Win Suit for Recovery on Title, on the Strength of his Title</u></strong></p>
<ol class="wp-block-list" style="list-style-type:1"></ol>
<p>In <strong>Vijay Pullarwar v. Shri Hanuman Deostan, (2019) 11 SCC 718</strong>, the suit for possession instituted by the plaintiffs trust on the basis of title, was found to be devoid of merits; for, there was no reference in the registration application of the public trust under the BPT Act, 1950 or in schedule I, where to record the properties of the public trust, that the suit property belonged to the trust. Our Apex Court held as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“Needless to observe that the plaintiffs/respondents were primarily obliged to establish their title in the suit house bearing No.878 in Circle No.3 where the Padukas of Saint Haridas Baba have been installed, as being the property of the plaintiff trust. The plaintiffs must succeed or fail on the title they establish; and if they fail to do so, they must fail to get the relief of possession irrespective of title of the defendant in the suit property (See: Brahma Nand Puri v. Naki Puri, (1965) 2 SCR 233 and Bajaranglal Shivchandrai Ruia v. Shashikant N. Ruia, (2004) 5 SCC 272).”</li>
</ul>
<p>In <strong>Brahma Nand Puri v. Neki Puri, AIR 1965 SC 1506,</strong> the Apex Court held as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“The plaintiff’s suit being one for ejectment he has to succeed or fail on the file that he establishes and if he cannot succeed on the strength of his title his suit must fail <span style="text-decoration: underline">notwithstanding that the defendant in possession has no title to the property</span>… …”</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">If Title of Plaintiff is Nullity, Defendant Need Not file a Substantive Suit</span><span style="text-decoration: underline">; </span></strong></p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">Plaintiff in ejection  suit must succeed or fail on his title</span></strong></li>
<li><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">If Plaintiff Shows Apparent Title, Defendant to Plead Defects Thereon</span></strong></li>
</ul>
<p>In <span style="text-decoration: underline">Bajaranglal Shivchandrai Ruia v. Shashikant N. Ruia, AIR 2004 SC 2546</span>, the defendants contended that the plaintiff’s title, on the basis of the alleged auction sale ‘was a nullity, as it was ultra vires the legal provisions and on the ground of lack of jurisdiction, non-service of demand notice on all the heirs and co-owners’. <span style="text-decoration: underline">It was <strong>contended</strong></span> from the part of the (original) plaintiff <span style="text-decoration: underline">that</span> the <span style="text-decoration: underline">sale proceedings could be challenged only by way of a substantive suit</span>, and that the High Court was right in characterising the challenge to the suit by the defendant as a ‘backdoor method’. The Apex Court held as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“If the title claimed by the plaintiff was a nullity and wholly void, there was no need for any of the <span style="text-decoration: underline">defendants</span> including Bajranglal to challenge it by way of a substantive suit. They <span style="text-decoration: underline">could always set up nullity of title as a defence</span> in any proceeding taken against them based upon such title. <span style="text-decoration: underline">If, in fact, the sale was a nullity, it was non est</span> in the eye of law and all that defendant had to do was point this out. (See in this connection: Ajudh Raz and Ors. v. Moti S/o Mussadi, [1991] 3 SCC 136 and the opinion of the Full Bench of the Bombay High Court in Abdulla Mian v. Government of Bombay, (1942) 44 Bom LR 577.</li>
<li>In Vidyadhar v. Manikrao and Anr., [1999] 3 SCC 573, the plaintiff had filed a suit on the basis of a sale deed executed by D-2 in his favour and sought the relief of possession of the property from defendant no. 1 who was an absolute stranger to the sale deed. The question which arose was whether defendant No. l, who was in possession, could justify his possession by urging the nullity of sale transaction between the plaintiff and defendant No. 2. In these circumstances, this Court held (vide para 21):
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>‘The above decisions appear to be based on the principle that a person in his capacity as a <span style="text-decoration: underline">defendant can raise any legitimate plea available to him</span> under law to defeat the suit of the plaintiff. This would <span style="text-decoration: underline">also include</span> the plea that the <span style="text-decoration: underline">sale deed</span> by which the title to the property was intended to be conveyed <span style="text-decoration: underline">to the plaintiff was void</span> or fictitious or, for that matter, collusive and not intended to be acted upon. Thus, the <span style="text-decoration: underline">whole question would depend upon the pleadings</span> of the parties, the nature of the suit, the nature of the deed, the <span style="text-decoration: underline">evidence led by the parties</span> in the suit and other attending circumstances.’</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Here, the <span style="text-decoration: underline">plaintiffs suit is for ejection of the defendant and for possession</span> of the suit property. <span style="text-decoration: underline">She must succeed or fail on the title</span> that she establishes. If she cannot succeed in proving her title, the suit must fail notwithstanding that the <span style="text-decoration: underline">defendant in possession may or may not have title</span> to the property. (See in this connection: Brahma Nand Puri v. Neki Puri, [1965] 2 SCR 233 at p. 237).</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline">Appellant Bajranglal had sufficiently pleaded</span> in his written statement the <span style="text-decoration: underline">defects in the title of the plaintiff</span> and it was, therefore, open for the learned Single Judge to go into this question <span style="text-decoration: underline">and decide if the plaintiff had good title or not</span>. …… In our view, the finding of the learned Single Judge that the plaintiff’s title was invalid and non est for contravention of the provisions of Section 206 of the BMC Act and the Regulations made thereunder, is fully justified and brooked no interference in appeal. ……. In our view, the principle in Vidyadhar’s case clearly applies to the case on hand.”</li>

<p>In a suit for recovery on title, where both plaintiff and defendant claim title, if <span style="text-decoration: underline"><mark class="has-inline-color has-foreground-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">plaintiff has been able to create a high degree of probability</mark></span>, he will Win,  if the defendant fails to discharge his onus. In <strong>R.V.E. Venkatachala Gounder v. Arulmigu Viswesaraswami</strong>, AIR 2003 SC 4548: (2003) 8 SCC 752, the law is stated in the following terms :</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“29. In a suit for recovery of possession based on title it <span style="text-decoration: underline">is for the plaintiff to prove his title</span> and satisfy the court that he, in law, is entitled to dispossess the defendant from his possession over the suit property and for the possession to be restored to him. However, as held in A. Raghavamma v. A. Chenchamma there is an essential distinction between burden of proof and onus of proof: burden of proof lies upon a person who has to prove the fact and which never shifts. Onus of proof shifts. Such a shifting of onus is a continuous process in the evaluation of evidence. In our opinion, in a <span style="text-decoration: underline">suit for possession based on title</span> once the <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline"><mark class="has-inline-color has-primary-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">plaintiff has been able to create a high degree of probability</mark></span></strong><mark class="has-inline-color has-primary-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><strong> </strong>so as to <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">shift the onus</span></strong></mark><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong> </strong></span><mark class="has-inline-color has-primary-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">on the defendant</span></strong> <span style="text-decoration: underline">it is for the defendant to discharge his onus</span> </mark><mark class="has-inline-color has-foreground-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">and in the absence thereof the burden of proof lying on the plaintiff shall be held to have been discharged so as to amount to proof of the plaintiff’s title.” </mark>(Quoted in: Anil.

</ul>
<p>In Smriti Debbarma v. Prabha Ranjan Debbarma, 2023 SCC OnLine SC 9,it is held bu our Apex Court as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“31. The burden of proof
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li class="has-xs-font-size">[See Paragraph 19 in Anil Rishi v. Gurbaksh Singh, (2006) 5 SCC 558 where the expression ‘burden of proof’ is used in three ways, namely, (i) to indicate the duty of bringing forward evidence in support of a proposition at the beginning or later; (ii) to make that of establishing a proposition as against all counter-evidence; and (iii) an indiscriminate use in which it may mean either, or both of the others.]</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>to establish a title in the present case lies upon the plaintiff as this burden lies on the party who asserts the existence of a particular state of things on the basis of which she claims relief [See Addagada Raghavamma and Another v. Addagada Chenchamma and Another, AIR 1964 SC 136.] This is mandated in terms of Sec. 101
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li class="has-xs-font-size">[Sec. 101: Burden of Proof.- Whoever desires any Court to give judgment as to any legal right or liability dependent on the existence of facts which he asserts, must prove that those facts exist. When a person is bound to prove the existence of any fact, it is said that the burden of proof lies on that person.]</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>of the Evidence Act, which states that burden on proving the fact rests with party <span style="text-decoration: underline">who substantially asserts in the affirmative and not on the party which is denying it</span>. This rule may not be universal and has exceptions,[See Ss. 103, 104 and 105 of the Evidence Act.] but in the factual background of the present case, the general principle is applicable. In terms of Sec. 102
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li class="has-xs-font-size">[Sec. 102: On whom the burden of proof lies.- The burden of proof in a suit or proceeding lies on that person who would fail if no evidence at all were given on either side.]</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>of the Evidence Act, <span style="text-decoration: underline">if both parties fail to adduce evidence</span>, the suit must fail.[See Anil Rishi v. Gurbaksh Singh, (2006) 5 SCC 558.] <mark class="has-inline-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#1a0eee">Onus of proof, no doubt shifts and the shifting is a continuous process in the evaluation of evidence, but this happens when <strong>in a suit for title and possession</strong>, the <strong>plaintiff has been able to create a high degree of probability</strong> <strong>to shift the onus on the defendant</strong>.</mark> In the absence of such evidence, the burden of proof lies on the plaintiff and <span style="text-decoration: underline">can be discharged only when he is able to prove title</span>.[See R.V.E. Venkatachala Gounder  v. Arulmigu Viswesaraswami  V.P. Temple and Another, (2003) 8 SCC 752.] The<span style="text-decoration: underline"> weakness of the defence cannot be a justification to decree the suit</span>. [See Union of India and Others v. Vasavi Cooperative Housing Society Limited and Others, (2014) 2 SCC 269.] The plaintiff could have succeeded in respect of the Schedule ‘A’ property if she had discharged the burden to prove the title to the Schedule ‘A’ property which squarely falls on her. This would be the true effect of Ss. 101 and 102 of the Evidence Act. [See Sebastiao Luis Fernandes (DEAD) Through LRs. And Others v. K.V.P. Shastri (DEAD) Through LRs. And Others, (2013) 15 SCC 161.]</li>
<li>Therefore, it follows that the plaintiff should have satisfied and discharged the burden under the provisions of the Evidence Act, failing which the suit would be liable to be dismissed.”</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">Burden of Proof General Principles</span></strong> <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">and Nuances of Sections 101 to 106</span></strong></p>
<p>Our Apex Court in <strong>Mohd.  Abdullah Azam Khan Vs. Nawab Kazim Ali Khan</strong>, <strong>2023 KLT OnLine 1084 </strong>(SC), authoritatively lays down the General principles as to Burden of Proof. It reads:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>12.1. The legal scheme governing various aspects of ‘burden of proof’ in the Indian context, is contained in <strong>Sections 101 to 106</strong> of the Indian Evidence Act.</li>
<li>12.2. As per <span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Section 101</strong></span> of the Indian Evidence Act, when <span style="text-decoration: underline">a person is bound to prove the existence of any fact</span>, it is said that the <span style="text-decoration: underline">burden of proof lies on that person</span>. This section is based on the rule, ei incumbit probatio qui dicit, non qui negat, which means that the burden of proving a fact rests on the party <span style="text-decoration: underline">who substantially asserts the affirmative</span> of the issue and <span style="text-decoration: underline">not upon the party who denies it</span>, because a <span style="text-decoration: underline">negative is usually incapable of proof</span>. The burden of proving a fact always lies upon the person who asserts and <span style="text-decoration: underline">until such burden is discharged</span>, the <span style="text-decoration: underline">other party is not required to be called upon</span> to prove his case. The <span style="text-decoration: underline">court has to examine</span> as to whether the person upon <span style="text-decoration: underline">whom the burden lies</span> has been able to discharge his burden. However, the above rule is subject to the general principle that <span style="text-decoration: underline">things admitted need not be proved</span>. </li>
<li>12.3. The question as to whether burden of proof has been discharged by a party to the lis or not, would depend upon the <span style="text-decoration: underline">facts and circumstances of the case</span>. <span style="text-decoration: underline">If the facts are admitted </span>or, if otherwise, <span style="text-decoration: underline">sufficient materials</span> have been brought on record so as to enable a Court to arrive at a definite conclusion, <span style="text-decoration: underline">it is idle to contend that the party on whom the burden of proof </span>lies would still be liable to produce direct evidence, vide National Insurance Co. Ltd. vs. Rattani (2009) 2 SCC 75: AIR 2009 SC 1499.</li>
<li>12.4. <span style="text-decoration: underline">Burden to prove documents lie on plaintiff alone</span> as onus is always on the person asserting a proposition or fact which is not self­evident. This position is summarised in the observation to the effect that, an assertion that <span style="text-decoration: underline">a man who is alive was born requires no proof; the onus, is not on the person making the assertion</span>, because <span style="text-decoration: underline">it is self­evident that he had been born</span>. But <span style="text-decoration: underline">to assert</span> that he had been born <span style="text-decoration: underline">on a certain date,</span> if the date is material, requires proof; <span style="text-decoration: underline">the onus is on the person making the assertion</span>, vide Robins vs. National Trust &amp; Co. Ltd. 1927 AC 515: 101 IC 903.</li>
<li>12.5. It is also to be noted at this juncture that there is an essential <span style="text-decoration: underline">distinction between burden of proof and onus of proof</span>. B<span style="text-decoration: underline">urden of proof</span> lies upon a person who has to prove the fact and it <span style="text-decoration: underline">never shifts</span>, onus of proof on the other hand, shifts. Such a shifting of onus is a continuous process in the evaluation of evidence. For instance, In a <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">suit for possession based on title,</span> </strong>once the <span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>plaintiff has been able to create a high degree of probability so as to shift the onus on the defendant</strong></span>, <span style="text-decoration: underline">it is for the defendant to discharge his onus</span> and in the absence thereof, the burden of proof lying on the plaintiff shall be held to have been discharged so as to amount to proof of the plaintiffs title, vide <span style="text-decoration: underline">RVE Venkatachala Gounder vs. Arulmigu Viswesaraswami and VP Temple AIR 2003 SC 4548</span>: (2003) 8 SCC 752. </li>
<li>12.6. In terms of <strong>section 102</strong> of the Evidence Act, the <span style="text-decoration: underline">initial burden to prove its claim is always on the plaintiff</span> and if he discharges that burden and makes out a case which entitles him to a relief, the <span style="text-decoration: underline">onus shifts </span>to the defendant to prove those circumstances, if any, which would disentitle the plaintiff of the same.</li>
<li>12.7. Where, however, <span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>evidence has been led</strong></span> by the contesting parties, <span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>abstract considerations of onus are out of place</strong> and truth or otherwise must always be adjudged on the evidence led</span> by the parties [Kalwa Devadattam vs. Union, AIR 1964 SC 880] </li>
<li>12.8. As per <strong>Section 103</strong>, the burden of proof as to any particular fact lies on that person <span style="text-decoration: underline">who wishes the Court to believe in its existence</span>, unless it is provided by any law that the proof of that fact shall lie on any particular person. This section <span style="text-decoration: underline">amplifies the general rule in section 101 </span>that the burden of proof lies on the person <span style="text-decoration: underline">who asserts the affirmative</span> of the issue. It lays down that if a person wishes the court to believe in the existence of a particular fact, the onus of proving that fact, is on him, unless the burden of proving it is cast by any law on any particular person.</li>
<li>12.9. <strong>Section 105</strong> is an application of the rule in section 103. When <span style="text-decoration: underline">parties to a dispute adduce evidence</span> to substantiate their claim, <span style="text-decoration: underline">onus becomes academic and divided</span>, entailing each party to prove their respective plea.</li>
<li>12.10. <strong>Section 106</strong> is an <span style="text-decoration: underline">exception to the general rule</span> laid down in Section 101, that the burden of proving a fact rest on the party who substantially asserts the affirmative of the issue. Section 106 is not intended to relieve any person of that duty or burden but states that when a fact to be proved is <span style="text-decoration: underline">peculiarly within the knowledge of a party,</span> it is for him to prove it. It applies to cases where the fact is especially within a party’s knowledge and to none else. The expression ‘especially’ used in Section 106 means facts that are eminently or <span style="text-decoration: underline">exceptionally within one’s knowledge.</span> This means a party having personal knowledge of certain facts has a duty to appear as a witness and if he does not go to the witness box, there is a strong presumption against him. In an Election Petition, the initial burden to prove determination of age of returned candidate lies on the petitioner, however, burden lies on the respondent to prove facts within his <span style="text-decoration: underline">special knowledge</span>. (Sushil Kumar vs. Rakesh Kumar [ (2003) 8 SCC 673) ]. </li>
<li>12.11. The provisions of Section 106 are unambiguous and categorical in laying down that when any fact is <span style="text-decoration: underline">especially within the knowledge</span> of a person, the burden of proving that fact is upon him. If he does so, he must be held to have discharged his burden but if he fails to offer an explanation on the basis of facts within his special knowledge, he<span style="text-decoration: underline"> fails to discharge</span> the burden cast upon him by Section 106. [Source: Sarkar on Law of Evidence, 20th Edition, Volume 2.] </li>
<li>12.12. In Sushil Kumar vs. Rakesh Kumar (supra), the controversy was with regard to the <span style="text-decoration: underline">improper acceptance of the nomination</span> of the sole respondent therein on the premise that he was under qualified to contest the Bihar Legislative Assemble election from 181, Parbatta Constituency. In the said case, inter alia, the horoscope of the respondent therein and admission register of New St. Xaviers School, Boring Road, Patna and transfer certificate issued by Swami Vivekananda Vidyalaya, Mithapur, Patna, were produced as documents to prove that the successful candidate therein was not eligible to contest the said Assembly election. In the said case, Section 35 of the Indian Evidence Act was referred to and it was observed that the <span style="text-decoration: underline">register maintained in terms of a statute or by a statutory authority in regular course of business would be a relevant fact</span> and if such vital evidence had been produced, it would clinch the issue. It was observed that there is <span style="text-decoration: underline">no reliable evidence on record </span>to show that the date of birth was recorded in the school register on the basis of the statement of any responsible person and that the <span style="text-decoration: underline">admission register or a transfer certificate issued by a primary school do not satisfy the requirements of Section 35</span> of the Evidence Act.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Supreme Court in the case of <strong>Gian Chand and Bros v. Rattan Lal</strong>, (2013) 2 SCC 606, has held as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>18. It is well-settled principle of law that a person <span style="text-decoration: underline">who asserts </span>a particular fact is required to affirmatively <span style="text-decoration: underline">establish it</span>. In Anil Rishi v. Gurbaksh Singh [(2006) 5 SCC 558] (SCC p. 561, para 9), it has been held that the burden of proving the facts rests on the party who substantially asserts the affirmative issues and <span style="text-decoration: underline">not the party who denies it</span> and the said principle may <span style="text-decoration: underline">not be universal</span> in its application and there may be an exception thereto. The purpose of referring to the same is that if the plaintiff asserts that the defendant had acknowledged the signature, it is obligatory on his part to substantiate the same. But the question would be what would be the consequence in a situation where the signatures are proven and there is an evasive reply in the written statement and what should be construed as substantiating the assertion made by the plaintiff.</li>
<li>19. In Krishna Mohan Kul v. Pratima Maity [(2004) 9 SCC 468] it has been ruled thus: (SCC p. 474, para 12) “12. … When <span style="text-decoration: underline">fraud, misrepresentation or undue influence</span> is alleged by a party in a suit, normally, the burden is on him to prove such fraud, undue influence or misrepresentation.”</li>
<li>20. In Shashi Kumar Banerjee v. Subodh Kumar Banerjee [AIR 1964 SC 529] a Constitution Bench of this Court, while dealing with a mode of proof of a will under the Succession Act, 1925 observed that where the caveator alleges <span style="text-decoration: underline">undue influence, fraud and coercion, the onus is on him</span> to prove the same.</li>
<li>21. In A. Raghavamma v. A. Chenchamma [AIR 1964 SC 136], while making a distinction between <strong><u>burden of proof and onus of proof</u></strong>, a three-Judge Bench opined thus: (AIR p. 143, para 12) “12. … There is an essential distinction between burden of proof and onus of proof: burden of proof lies upon the person who has to prove a fact and it never shifts, but the onus of proof shifts. The burden of proof in the present case undoubtedly lies upon the plaintiff to establish the factum of adoption and that of partition. The said circumstances do not alter the incidence of the burden of proof. Such considerations, having regard to the circumstances of a particular case, may shift the onus of proof. Such a shifting of onus is a continuous process in the evaluation of evidence.”</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">If Sale on which Title rests is Vitiated, Title will be Nullity</span></strong></p>
<p>It was held by the Bombay High Court in Sarang Avinash Kamtekar v. Alpha Organic (2005) relying on </p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>(1) Himadri Coke and Petro Ltd. v. Soneko Developers (P) Ltd., (2005) 12 SCC 364; </li>
<li>(2) <strong>Bajaranglal Shivchandrai Ruia v. Shashikant N. Ruia</strong>, 2004(3) SCR 373; and </li>
<li>(3) A.V. Papayya Sastry v. Government of A.P., (2007) 4 SCC 221.  </li>
</ul>
<p>that a sale on which title of a party to the suit rests is vitiated, title will be bad in law.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Principle Not Applicable with its Full Vigor in a suit filed by the State</strong></span></p>
<p>From <strong>R.V.E. Venkatachala Gounder v. Arulmigu Viswesaraswami</strong>, AIR 2003 SC 4548, it is clear that, though in a suit for recovery on title, <span style="text-decoration: underline">a plaintiff cannot argue that the defendant failed to prove his title</span>. </p>
<p>But, <mark class="has-inline-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#2712f0"><span style="text-decoration: underline">it may not be applicable with its full vigor in a suit filed by the State</span></mark>, for it is the paramount title holder of the property by virtue of the Constitution.</p>

<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">Law Recognises Efficacy of Possession in Section 6 of the Specific Relief Act</span></strong></p>
<p>Section 6 of the Specific Relief Act allows one to file a suit for recovery of property, on the strength of his prior possession, if he had lost his possession within 6 months of the suit. In such a case, he need not prove his title; and he can succeed on establishing that he has been dispossessed otherwise than in accordance with law within six months.</p>
<p>Sec. 6 of the Specific Relief Act, 1963 reads as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>6. <span style="text-decoration: underline">Suit by person dispossessed of immovable property.</span> (1) If any person is dispossessed without his consent of immovable property otherwise than in due course of law, he or any person claiming through him may, by suit, recover possession thereof, notwithstanding any other title that may be set up in such suit.</li>
<li>(2) No suit under this section shall be brought
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>(a) after the expiry of six months from the date of dispossession; or</li>
<li>(b) against the Government.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>(3) No appeal shall lie from any order or decree passed in any suit instituted under this section, nor shall any review of any such order or decree be allowed.</li>
<li>(4) Nothing in this section shall bar any person from suing to establish his title to such property and to recover possession thereof.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><u>If Title not Perfected by Adver. Posn, Can one Eject a Trespasser After 6 Months</u></strong></p>
<p>High Courts differ, as pointed out in Kuttan Narayanan v. Thomman Mathayi, AIR 1966 Ker 179.</p>
<p>Now it is settled that if one fails to exercise his option by filing a suit under Section 6 of the Specific Relief Act within six months, he is at liberty to file a suit to recover his possession (with or without declaration) by a regular suit for recovery of possession. It can be based on title or on his possession in assumed or presumed character of ownership (even if title not perfected by doctrine of adverse possession) on the principle that possession is good title against all the world but the rightful owner. See: Kuttan Narayanan v. Thomman Mathayi, AIR 1966 Ker 179; Kanti Lal v. Smt. Shanti Devi, AIR 1997 Raj 230.</p>

<p><strong><u>Even Rightful Owner</u></strong> <strong><u>to Take Recourse to law; He cannot take the law in his own hands</u></strong></p>
<p>In<strong> Rame Gowda v. M. Varadappa Naidu</strong>, (2004) 1 SCC 769, our Apex Court Court (<strong>R.C. Lahoti, </strong>B.N. Srikrishna, G.P. Mathur, JJ.) observed that the law will come to the aid of a person in peaceful and <strong>settled possession</strong> by injuncting even a <strong>rightful owner</strong>. It is held as under:­ </p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“8. It is thus clear that so far as the Indian law is concerned the person in peaceful possession is entitled to retain his possession and in order to protect such possession he may even use reasonable force to keep out a trespasser.</li>
<li>A <strong>rightful owner</strong> who has been wrongfully dispossessed of land may retake possession if he can do so peacefully and without the use of unreasonable force.</li>
<li>If the trespasser is in <strong><u>settled possession</u></strong> of the property belonging to the <strong>rightful owner</strong>, the rightful owner shall have to take recourse to law; he cannot take the law in his own hands and evict the trespasser or interfere with his possession. </li>
<li>The law will come to the aid of a person in peaceful and <strong>settled possession</strong> by injuncting even a <strong>rightful owner</strong>from using force or taking law in his own hands, and also by restoring him in possession even from the rightful owner (of course subject to the law of limitation), if the latter has dispossessed the prior possessor by use of force.</li>
<li>In the absence of proof of better title, possession or prior peaceful <strong>settled possession</strong> is itself evidence of title. <strong>Law presumes the possession to go with the title unless rebutted</strong>. The owner of any property may prevent even by using reasonable force a trespasser from an attempted trespass, when it is in the process of being committed, or is of a flimsy character, or recurring, intermittent, stray or casual in nature, or has just been committed, while the <strong><u>rightful owner</u></strong> did not have enough time to have recourse to law. In the last of the cases, the possession of the trespasser, just entered into would not be called as one acquiesced to by the true owner.” (quoted in: Subramanya Swamy Temple, Ratnagiri v. V. Kanna Gounder, 2009-3 SCC 306; Poona Ram v. Moti Ram, AIR 2019 SC 813)</li>
</ul>
<p>What is the <strong>settled possession</strong> or effective possession of a person without title which would entitle him to protect his possession even as against the true owner was made clear in Rame Gowda v. M. Varadappa Naidu, (2004) 1 SCC 769. It reads as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“9. …The “<strong>settled possession</strong>” must be (i) effective, (ii) undisturbed, and (iii) to the knowledge of the owner or without any attempt at concealment by the trespasser. The phrase “<strong>settled possession</strong>” does not carry any special charm or magic in it; nor is it a ritualistic formula which can be confined in a straitjacket. An occupation of the property by a person as an agent or a servant acting at the instance of the owner will not amount to actual physical possession.” (quoted in Samarpan Varishtha Jan Parisar vs Rajendra Prasad Agarwal, AIR 2022 SC 2209)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><u>Even the Rightful Owner cannot Eject a Trespasser with Force</u></strong></p>
<p>In Karthiyayani Amma v. Govindan, AIR 1980 Ker 224, the Kerala High Court considered the question whether the rightful owner can eject a trespasser in possession with force; and whether a person in illegal possession could sustain a suit for injunction against the true owner, from forcibly dispossessing him from the property.  It was held as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“The ultimate position, therefore, reduces itself to this:</li>
<li>Can a person in possession without title sustain a suit for injunction against the rightful owner if he proves possession?</li>
<li>Yes. In this case, plaintiff is found to in be possession. On the finding, he should be granted the injunction prayed for. A person in possession can be evicted only in due process of law. Even the rightful owner cannot eject him with force. If he cannot be evicted with force, he continues to be in possession and he can resist invasion of his possession by everyone including the rightful owner. If the rightful owner threatens his peaceful possession, he can approach Courts of Law and pray for the equitable relief of injunction to protect his possession”. (Followed in: Aiysumma v. Mariyamma, 1994-2 CIVCC 52, 1994-1 KerLT 570. )</li>
</ul>
<p>It is pointed out in Suresh v. Ashok Girdharilal Chandak, 2016-1 MHLJ 171 that ‘bearing in mind the basic principle of law in civil jurisprudence that even a trespasser cannot be evicted without following due process of law and no one can be allowed to take law into his own hands to recover possession of the property without following due process of law and without proving title to the immovable property in possession of a person holding actual physical possession thereof’.</p>
<p><strong><u>No Injunction in Favour of a Trespasser, Against the ‘True Owner’</u></strong></p>
<p>It is observed by our Apex Court, in Prataprai N. Kothari v. John Braganza, AIR 1999 SC 1666, as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“It is quite obvious that the learned single Judge had not taken note of the principle of possessory title or the principle of law that a person who has been in long continuous possession can protect the same by seeking an injunction against any person in the world <strong><u>other than</u></strong> the <strong>true owner</strong>. It is also well settled that even the owner of the property can get back his possession only by resorting to <strong>due process of law</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Divergent Views are set out in Sopan Sukhdeo Sable v. Assistant Charity Commissioner, AIR 2004 SC 1801 also. They are the following:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>first, a person in <strong>settled possession</strong> cannot be disposed by the owner except by recourse of law</li>
<li>second, a trespasser in possession cannotnot seek injunction against the <strong>true owner</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>In this case, a forceful postulation is posed-</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>A trespasser ousted can seek restoration of possession under Section 6 of the Specific Relief Act, 1963, (even) against the true owner. If so, can’t the trespasser seek injunction as to possession, against the true owner?</li>
</ul>
<p>In Sopan Sukhdeo Sable v. Assistant Charity Commissioner, AIR 2004 SC 1801, the appellants were the plaintiffs whose suit was rejected in terms of Order VII, Rule 11 of the Code of Civil Procedure. It is held in this decision as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“24. There are two different sets of principles which have to be borne in mind regarding course to be adopted in case of forcible dispossession. Taking up the first aspect, it is true that where a person is in <strong><u>settled possession</u></strong> of property, even on the assumption that he has no right to remain in property, he cannot be disposed by the owner except by recourse of law. This principle is laid down in Section 6 of the Specific Relief Act, 1963. That Section says that if any person is dispossession without his consent from immovable property otherwise than in due course of law, he or any person claiming through him may, by suit, recover possession thereof, notwithstanding any other title that may be set up in such suit. That a person without title but in “settled” possession – as against mere fugitive possession – can get back possession if forcibly dispossessed or rather, if dispossessed otherwise than by due process of law, has been laid down in several cases. It was so held by this Court in<ul><li>Yashwant Singh v. Jagdish Singh, AIR 1968 SC 620,</li></ul><ul><li>Krishna Ram Mohate v. Mrs. Shobha Venkata Rao, (1989) 4 SCC 131 at p. 136;</li></ul><ul><li>Ram Rattan v. State of UP, (1977) 1 SCC 188, and</li></ul>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>State of UP v. Maharaja Dharmender Prasad Singh, (1989) 2 SCC 505.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The leading decision quoted in these rulings is the decision of the Bombay High Court in
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>K. K. Verma vs. Union of India, AIR 1954 Bom 358.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>25. Now the <strong>other aspect</strong> of the matter needs to be noted. Assuming a trespasser ousted can seek restoration of possession under Section 6 of the Specific Relief Act, 1963 can the trespasser seek injunction against the true owner<strong>?</strong></li>
<li>This question does not entirely depend upon Section 6 of the Specific Relief Act, but mainly depends upon certain general principles applicable to the law of injunctions and as to the scope of the exercise of discretion while granting injunction.</li>
<li>In Mahadeo Savlaram Sheike vs. Pune Municipal Corporation, (1995) 3 SCC 33, it was held, after referring to Woodrofe on “Law relating to injunction: L. C. Goyal Law of injunctions:
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>David Bean Injunction Jayce on Injunctions and other leading Articles on the subject that the appellant who was a trespasser in possession <strong>could not seek injunction against the true owner</strong>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>In that context this Court quoted Shiv Kumar Chadha vs. MCD, (1993) 3 SCC 161, wherein it was observed that injunction is discretionary and that:
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“Judicial proceedings cannot be used to protect or to perpetuate a wrong committed by a person who approaches the Court.”</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>26. Reference was also made to Dalpat Kumar vs. Prahlad Singh (1992) 1 SCC 719 in regard to the meaning of the words prima facie case and balance of convenience and observed in Mahadeos case (supra) that:
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“It is settled law that no injunction could be granted against the owner at the instance of a person in unlawful possession.”</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>27. The question of forcible possession as claimed is also a matter which can be pressed into service by the parties before the trial Court and if raised the Court shall deal with it considering its relevance to the suit and accept it or otherwise reject the plea in accordance with law. We do not think it necessary to express any opinion in that regard.</li>
<li>28. …. Looking into the nature of dispute it would be appropriate if the trial Court makes an effort to complete the trial within six months from the date of the judgment. The parties are directed to co-operate for disposal of the suit early within the stipulated time. The appeal is allowed to the extent indicated without any order as to costs.”</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Burden on plaintiff </strong></span></span><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">to Prove Title</span></strong><span style="text-decoration: underline"><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>; Weakness of defence</strong> <strong>would not enable a decree</strong></span></span></p>
<p>In <span style="text-decoration: underline">Ram Chandra Sakharam Mahajan Vs. Damodar Trimbak, AIR 2007 SC 2577</span>, it is observed  –</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>In a recovery on title suit, the burden is on the plaintiff to establish title.</li>
<li>Court is also entitled to consider the <strong>rival title set up by the defendants</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Weakness of defence</strong> to establish title, would not enable plaintiff to a decree.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Apex Court held:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“The suit is for <strong>recovery</strong> of possession on the strength of title. Obviously, the <strong>burden is on the plaintiff to establish that title</strong>. No doubt in appreciating the case of title set up by the plaintiff, the <strong>Court is also entitled to consider the rival title set up by the defendants</strong>. But the <strong>weakness of the defence </strong>or the failure of the defendants to establish the title set up by them, <strong>would not enable the plaintiff</strong> to a decree. There cannot be any demur to these propositions.”</li>
<li>“14. We find that the trial Court and the appellate Court were <strong>not justified in refusing the amendment of the plaint</strong> sought for by the plaintiff. No doubt there had been delay in seeking amendment but that delay could have been compensated by awarding costs to the contesting defendants 1 to 9. Therefore, we are satisfied that the amendment sought for by the plaintiff ought to have been allowed. We are inclined to allow the amendment sought for, since it would <strong><u>enable the Court to pin-pointedly consider the real dispute between the parties</u></strong> and would enable it to render a decision more satisfactorily to its conscience. We, therefore, allow the amendment as sought for by the plaintiff at a belated stage. The amendment will be carried out by the plaintiff in the trial Court within three months from this date as per the practice followed in the trial Court. Obviously defendants 1 to 9 would have an opportunity to file an additional written statement to the amended plaint. They will be entitled to file an additional written statement within a period of four months from the date of this judgment.”</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><u>Possession is Good Against All But the True Owner</u></strong></p>
<p>The principle that ‘possession is good against all but the true owner’ is stated in Nair Service Society Ltd. v. K.C. Alexander, AIR 1968 SC 1165, referring Judicial Committee decision in Parry v. Clissold, (1907) AC 73, as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“17. In our judgment this involves an incorrect approach to our problem. To express our meaning we may begin by reading 1907 AC 73, to discover if the principle that possession is good against all but the true owner has in any way been departed from. 1907 AC 73 reaffirmed the principle by stating quite clearly:
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“It cannot be disputed that a person in possession of land in the assumed character of owner and exercising peaceably the ordinary rights of ownership has a perfectly good title against all the world but the rightful owner. And if the rightful owner does not come forward and assert his title by the process of law within the period prescribed by the provisions of the statute of Limitation applicable to the case, his right is for ever extinguished and the possessory owner acquires an absolute title.”</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p><strong><u>Document ex-facie reveals no title – specific declaration as to invalidity not necessary</u></strong></p>
<p>The Supreme Court held in Kizhakke Vattakandiyil Madhavan v. Thiyyurkunnath Meethal Janaki (Aniruddha Bose &amp; Sudhanshu DhuliaJJ.) 9.4.2024, held as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“18. …. If a document seeking to convey immovable property ex-facie reveals that the conveyer does not have the title over the same, specific declaration that the document is invalid would not be necessary. The Court can examine the title in the event any party to the proceeding sets up this defence. Chiruthey could not convey any property over which she did not have any right or title. Her right, if any, would stem from the second deed of lease (Exhibit A-1). We are conscious of the fact that no claim was made before any forum for invalidating the deed dated 14th July 1910 (Exhibit A-20).”</li>

If right, title or interest in certain property is sought conveyed by a person by an instrument who herself does not possess any such form of entitlement on the subject being conveyed, even with a subsisting deed of conveyance on such property, the grantee on her successors-in-interest will not have legal right to enforce the right the latter may have derived from such an instrument.”</li>
