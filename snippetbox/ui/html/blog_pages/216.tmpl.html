<li>the cause of action (interruption or threat) contemplated in Para 5 is that arises after perfection of easement after completion of 20 years, and</li>

<p>2<sup>nd</sup> part of Explanation II (that is, an <span style="text-decoration: underline">obstruction</span> for a period <span style="text-decoration: underline"><mark class="has-inline-color has-primary-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">up to</mark><mark class="has-inline-color has-foreground-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"> </mark><mark class="has-inline-color has-primary-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><mark class="has-inline-color has-primary-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">One Year</mark></mark></span> will not stand as an interruption) is an enabling provision that stands in favour of the dominant owner (claimant of the easement), for the following reasons –</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>(1) ‘interruption’ is a (negative) matter that stands against (perfection of) easement by prescription, and</li>
<li>(2) Explanation II lays down – if only the dominant owner acquiesced obstruction, for a period <strong>more than <u>one year</u></strong>, then only it will operate as an ‘interruption’ against acquiring easement.</li>
<li><strong>Note: </strong>1. It is clear that the pleading as to ‘interruption, for more than <u><mark class="has-inline-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#121cf3">one year</mark></u>‘ has to come (in most cases) from the servient owner (to show<span style="text-decoration: underline"> no </span>perfection of easement by prescription). Therefore, the burden of proving obstruction, for <strong>more than <strong><strong><u><mark class="has-inline-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#121cf3">one year</mark></u></strong></strong></strong>, will be upon the servient owner.</li>
<li>2. When this plea is raised by the servient owner-</li>
<li>(i) he has to <span style="text-decoration: underline">admit</span> the enjoyment of the right claimed up to the date of obstruction; and</li>
<li>(ii) if that plea is resisted by the dominant owner, saying that the period of obstruction is below one year, then it will be a question of fact.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>6. <span style="text-decoration: underline">Reckoning of <u><mark class="has-inline-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#121cf3">one year</mark></u> period</span></strong></p>
<p>Explanation II makes it clear – </p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>the period of <strong><strong><strong><u><mark class="has-inline-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#121cf3">one year</mark></u></strong></strong></strong> is reckoned (1) from the date of notice of the obstruction by the claimant and (2) after getting the knowledge of the person who made the obstruction, or the person who authorised the same to be made.</li>
</ul>
<p>This plea can be validly raised by the dominant owner (claimant of easement) in the following set of facts –</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>The servient owner interrupts/obstructs a way by constructing a wall, a few months prior to completion of 20-year-period (for acquiring easement by prescription).</li>
<li>Acquiescing the obstruction, the dominant owner (claimant of easement) purchases a nearby property and makes an (alternate) way.</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline">After completion of 20 years period</span> (as regards the earlier way) and within one year of ‘acquiescing’ obstruction, the dominant owner can validly claim easement by prescription over that way invoking this provision.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>7.</strong> <strong><u>Why No Limitation of 3 years as usually seen in Limitation Act</u>?</strong></p>
<p><mark class="has-inline-color has-foreground-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">‘Obstruction’ </mark><mark class="has-inline-color has-primary-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">up to</mark><mark class="has-inline-color has-foreground-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"> </mark><mark class="has-inline-color has-primary-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><mark class="has-inline-color has-primary-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">One Year </mark></mark><mark class="has-inline-color has-foreground-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">being not counted</mark><mark class="has-inline-color has-primary-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"> </mark>(for the purpose of Sec. 15, as per Explanation II) in cases of acquiescence by the dominant owner (that is, in spite of notice of obstruction, no attempt made to remove it), <strong>2 years’</strong> limitation period (in Sec. 15 para 5) will begin only after the said period “<mark class="has-inline-color has-primary-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">for</mark> <mark class="has-inline-color has-primary-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><mark class="has-inline-color has-primary-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><strong>One Year</strong></mark></mark><mark class="has-inline-color has-foreground-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">“.</mark></p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>That is, in cases <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">where there is acquiescence</span></strong> to obstruction for a period up to one year, the period of ‘limitation’ will be <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong><mark class="has-inline-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#330ef6">3 years</mark></strong></span></strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Hence, in cases where there is acquiescence (up to one year) after perfection of the 20-year period, suit can be filed –</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>on the next day of completing the ‘20-years-user’; </li>
<li>or, within <strong><mark class="has-inline-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#0f18e9">three years</mark></strong> of obstruction.</li>
</ul>
<p>But, it is obvious:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>If the dominant owner has made an attempt to remove obstruction (or interfered, in contrast to <strong><u>acquiescence</u></strong>), the limitation of two years will run from that date.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>8. <span style="text-decoration: underline">‘Without Interruption’ in Section 15 is congruent to ‘Peaceable Enjoyment’</span></strong></p>
<p>Explanation II to Section 15 explains ‘interruption’ as ‘actual cessation’ for ‘obstruction’. Therefore,</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>‘Without interruption’ in Section 15 is congruent to ‘peaceable enjoyment’; and actual cessation by obstruction’ alone negatives ‘peaceable enjoyment’.</li>
<li>In other words, ‘peaceable enjoyment’ also stands <em>on par</em> with (similar to) the explanation to ‘interruption’ (that is, there must be actual obstruction, more than a verbal dispute, or legal proceedings).</li>
</ul>
<p>See:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Muthu Goundan v. Anantha Goundan, AIR 1916 Mad. 1001: 31 Ind Cas 528</li>

<li>Eaton v. The Swansea Waterworks Company, [1851] EngR 559, (1851) 17 QB 267, (1851) 117 ER 1282.</li>
</ul>
<p>In Tagore Law Lectures delivered by Peacock deduces, from the cases, that “peaceable enjoyment” means “enjoyment without interruption or opposition of the servient owner sufficient to defeat the enjoyment”, and “that obstruction or opposition to enjoyment must find expression in something done on the servient tenement or the legal proceedings.” </p>

<p><strong> 9.  <span style="text-decoration:underline">Two-years’-period in Sec. 15, and <em>20 years’ non-user</em> under Sec. 47</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration:underline">Section 47 of the Indian Easements Act reads as under:</span></p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>“</strong>A continuous easement is extinguished when it totally ceases to be enjoyed as such for an unbroken period of twenty years. </li>
<li>A discontinuous easement is extinguished when, for a like period, it has not been enjoyed as such.” </li>
</ul>
<p><span style="text-decoration:underline">Section 47 Analysed</span></p>
<p>On analysis, it can be seen that Section 47 is attracted in the following situation:</p>
<ol class="has-small-font-size wp-block-list">
<li>There should be cessation of (perfected) easement, for an unbroken period of twenty years.</li>
<li>The involvement or interference of servient owner is not regarded in Section 47; abstention of the the person claiming the easement (dominant owner) alone is considered.  </li>
</ol>
<p><span style="text-decoration:underline">Sec. 15 may appear, on a first look, to be inconsistent with Sec. 47</span></p>
<p>Para 5 of Section 15 may appear, on a first look, to be inconsistent with Sec. 47; for,  Para 5 of Section 15 says as to suit (on interruption) within 2 years; and Section 47 says as to cessation of easement after 20 years. That is, in cases where two years period in Para 5 of Section 15 is attracted, there will be no scope for applying 20 years’ period in Sec. 47.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration:underline">Apparent Inconsistency</span> (<span style="text-decoration:underline">on  Para 5 of Sec. 15</span> <span style="text-decoration:underline">and Sec. 47</span>) <span style="text-decoration:underline">Solved</span> </p>
<p>Para 5 of Section 15 speaks as to filing suits within <span style="text-decoration:underline">two years</span> of <span style="text-decoration:underline">cessation</span> of easement. Sec. 47 says as to <span style="text-decoration:underline">extinguishment</span> for non-enjoyment of <span style="text-decoration:underline">twenty years</span>.  A combined evaluation of both these sections, leads to the following propositions: </p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><span style="text-decoration:underline">Para 5 of Section 15</span> says as to <span style="text-decoration:underline">‘<strong>interruption</strong></span>‘. It  must be (by virtue of Explanation II to Sec. 15):
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>(a) by servient owner (or someone other than the claimant) </li>
<li>(b) after perfection of prescriptive right (20 years etc.) and </li>
<li>(c) within <span style="text-decoration:underline">two years</span> next before the institution of the suit.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration:underline">Section 47</span> pertains to <span style="text-decoration:underline"><strong>extinguishment</strong></span> of perfected easement.  It is attracted when there is:
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li> <strong>non-enjoyment</strong> </li>
<li>for twenty years </li>
<li>by the <span style="text-decoration:underline">dominant owner himself</span>.
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>The involvement or interference of servient owner is not a factor in Section 47; </li>
<li>abstention of the dominant owner alone is considered.  </li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This view is fortified by the observations in Partap Singh v. Hemraj, AIR 1929 All. 497, which read as follows:</p>
<ul class="has-small-font-size wp-block-list">
<li>“The view taken by the lower Court that the suit should have been brought within two years of the cessation of the exercise of right is not correct. The lower Court appears to have overlooked Section 26, Lim. Act and Expln. 2, Section 15, Easements Act. Both these sections lay down that nothing is an interruption in a right of easement unless there has been an <span style="text-decoration:underline">actual cessation of the enjoyment by reason of an obstruction</span> by the act of some other person. The <span style="text-decoration:underline">mere failure to exercise the right for a period of two years does not extinguish</span> a right of easement. This view has been expressed in the case of Gopal Chandra Sen v. Bankim Behari [1920] 29 Cal LJ 421: 51 Ind Cas 372.” </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>10. <span style="text-decoration:underline"><strong>Is Right of (Prescriptive) Easement set-down (or got Perfected) by a Decree Alone</strong></span></strong></p>
<p>It was observed in Sultan Ahmad v. Valiullah (1912) 10 ALJ 227, that the result of the Easements Act and the similar provisions of the Limitation Act was that a right of (prescriptive) easement could not be said to be perfected until the right was set-down by a decree of court.

<p><strong>12.</strong> <strong><u>Should Date of Beginning of 20 Years be pleaded?</u></strong></p>
<p>In Justiniano Antao v. Bernadette B. Pereira, (2005) 1 SCC 471, it was pointed out as follows:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“In order to establish a right by way of prescription to the detriment of the other party, one has to show that the incumbent has been using the land as of right peacefully and openly and without any interruption for the last 20 years. There should be specific pleadings and categorical evidence in general and specifically that since what date to which date one is using the access for the last 20 years.”</li>
</ul>
<p>Kerala High Court, in Soman Nair v. Manoj Kumar, 2014 (P. Bhavadasan, J.) distinguished the decision Justiniano Antao v. Bernadette B. Pereira, observing as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“12. A reading of the decision reported in Justiniano Antao’s case (cited supra) would reveal that the dictum has to be read in the context of facts of the case. That was a case where the Apex Court found that till 1984, the claimant was using another way and only thereafter the claim over the way through servient tenement was made. A vague assertion had been made in the said case that the pathway has been used for a long time. It was under those circumstances, the Apex Court had occasion to hold as mentioned above.</li>
<li>13. In the case on hand, the definite pleading as could be culled out from the written statement and counter claim is that defendants as well as their predecessors-in-interest have been using the pathway in question for a long time in fact for more than 30 years and this is only means of access  to their property.”</li>
</ul>
<p>Pappachan v. Alex, ILR 2023-3 Ker 523; 2023-5 KHC 10, distinguished the decision Justiniano Antao v. Bernadette B. Pereira, observing as under: </p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“24. In Justiniano Antao (supra) there was no pleading by the plaintiff that she used the pathway in question for a period of 20 years. Holding that in the absence of such a pleading which is elementary and essential to claim a prescriptive easement right, the Apex Court held that the date from which the right of way was started to use should have been pleaded. The pleadings set forth by the appellants in this case certainly constitute sufficient pleadings to claim easement by prescription. It is true that they did not plead as to from which date they started using that pathway. They, however, pleaded that for the last more than 35 years they have been using that pathway. In the light of such a specific pleadings the law laid down in Justiniano Antao [(2005) 1 SCC 471] does not disentitle the appellants from claiming the relief.”</li>

<li><em>Illustrations</em></li>
<li> (a) A suit is brought in 1883 for obstructing a right of way. The defendant admits the obstruction, but denies the right of way. The plaintiff proves that the right was peaceably and openly enjoyed by him, claiming title thereto as an easement and as of right, without interruption, from 1st January, 1862 to 1st January, 1882. The plaintiff is entitled to judgment.</li>
<li>(b) In a like suit the plaintiff shows that the right was peaceably and openly enjoyed by him for twenty years. The defendant proves that for a year of that time the plaintiff was entitled to possession of the servient heritage as lessee thereof and enjoyed the right as such lessee. The suit shall be dismissed, for the right of way has not been enjoyed “as an easement” for twenty years.</li>
<li>(c) In a like suit the plaintiff shows that the right was peaceably and openly enjoyed by him for twenty years. The defendant proves that the plaintiff on one occasion during the twenty years had admitted that the user was not of right and asked his leave to enjoyed the right. The suit shall be dismissed, for the right of way has not been enjoyed “as of right” for twenty years.</li>

<li>Provided that if, in the case of a discontinuous easement, the dominant owner, within such period, registers, under the Indian Registration Act, 1877 (3 of 1877), a declaration of his intention to retain such easement, it shall not be extinguished until a period of twenty years has elapsed from the date of the registration. </li>
<li>Where an easement can be legally enjoyed only at a certain place, or at certain times, or between certain hours, or for a particular purpose, its enjoyment during the said period at another place, or at other times, or between other hours, or for another purpose, does not prevent its extinction under this section. </li>
<li>The circumstance that, during the said period, no one was in possession of the servient heritage, or that the easement could not be enjoyed, or that a right accessory thereto was enjoyed, or that the dominant owner was not aware of its existence, or that he enjoyed it in ignorance of his right to do so, does not prevent its extinction under this section. </li>
<li>An easement is not extinguished under this section-
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>(a) where the cessation is in pursuance of a contract between the dominant and servient owners;</li>
<li>(b) where the dominant heritage is held in co-ownership, and one of the co-owners enjoys the easement within the said period; or</li>
<li>(c) where the easement is a necessary easement.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Where several heritages are respectively subject to rights of way for the benefit of a single heritage, and the ways are continuous, such rights shall, for the purposes of this section, be deemed to be a single easement. </li>
<li>Illustration: A has, as annexed to his house, rights of way from the high road thither over the heritages X and Z and the intervening heritage Y. Before the twenty years expire, A exercises his right of way over X. His rights of way over Y and Z are not extinguished.</li>

<p><strong><span style="text-decoration:underline">Section 25 in The Limitation Act, 1963</span></strong></p>
<ul class="has-small-font-size wp-block-list">
<li><strong>25.</strong> <strong><span style="text-decoration:underline">Acquisition of easement by prescription</span></strong>.—(1) Where the access and use of light or air to and for any building have been peaceably enjoyed therewith as an easement, and as of right, without interruption, and for twenty years, and where any way or watercourse or the use of any water or any other easement (whether affirmative or negative) has been peaceably and openly enjoyed by any person claiming title thereto as an easement and as of right without interruption and for twenty years, the right to such access and use of light or air, way, watercourse, use of water, or other easement shall be absolute and indefeasible.</li>
<li>(2) Each of the <mark class="has-inline-color has-foreground-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">said periods</mark> of <span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong><mark class="has-inline-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#0e1fec">twenty years</mark></strong></span> shall be taken to be a period <span style="text-decoration:underline"><mark class="has-inline-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#1712f6"><strong>ending within two years next before the institution of the suit</strong></mark></span> wherein the claim to which such period relates is contested.</li>
<li>(3) Where the property over which a right is claimed under sub-section (1) belongs to the Government that sub-section shall be read as if for the words “twenty years” the words “thirty years” were substituted. </li>
<li>Explanation.—Nothing is an interruption within the meaning of this section, unless where there is an actual discontinuance of the possession or enjoyment by reason of an obstruction by the act of some person other than the claimant, and unless such obstruction is submitted to or acquiesced in for one year after the claimant has notice thereof and of the person making or authorising the same to be made.</li>
