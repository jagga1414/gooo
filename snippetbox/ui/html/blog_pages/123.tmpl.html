<p>Under the Indian Evidence Act, electronic evidence could have been taken as a third category of ‘evidence’, other than ‘oral’ and ‘documentary’ evidences. It is more so in view of the interpretation given to Sec. 65B by the Supreme Court in Arjun Panditrao v. Kailash Kushanrao, (2020)3 SCC 216. In this decision it was said that Electronic Evidence is (specially) dealt with “notwithstanding anything contained” in the Act.</p>
<p>By virtue of the definitions in the new act, it is made clear – Electronic Evidence is included in the ‘Documentary Evidence’. It is definite that it is with a view to expand the scope of the application of Electronic Records in evidence.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline">Changes on Primary Evidence – <span style="text-decoration: underline">Electronic Records are also Included</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline">in the category</span>, <span style="text-decoration: underline">Primary Evidence</span></span></p>

<p>The scope of application of Electronic Records in evidence is further expanded by the Additional Explanations 4 to 7 in Sec. 57 (as to ‘Primary Evidence’). Major changes having practical importance are the following:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Under Explanation 4, electronic or digital record that is stored in an electronic devise, simultaneously(or sequentially in multiple files) with that in the ‘creating’ devise, is also taken as ‘primary evidence’.
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Core-computer system in Banks and storing in ‘iCloud’ etc. are good examples for such storage.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Sixth explanation has also wider application. As is clear from the explanation, video recordings (a) simultaneously stored in electronic form and (b) transmitted or broadcasted can also be taken as primary evidence.</li>
<li>Explanation 5 renders a rider. Production of electronic or digital record from <span style="text-decoration: underline">proper custody</span> (unless it is disputed) is to be treated as ‘primary evidence’.
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Admission of electronic record contained in a stolen devise seized from the custody of accused is a good example for it.</li>

<p><u>Importance of this New Provision</u></p>
<p>The words in the new Sec. 61, “<strong><u>Nothing</u></strong> in this Adhiniyam <em><u>shall apply</u></em> to <strong>deny</strong> <strong>the admissibility</strong>” has great significance.  It is made to expand the scope of admissibility of Electronic Evidence. </p>
<p>The non-obstante clause <sub>(‘<em>notwithstanding anything</em><strong><em> </em></strong><em>contained in the Act</em>’)</sub> in Sec. 65B (Sec. 63, BSA) is capable of giving two (divergent) interpretations –</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>First, Sec. 65B  (Sec. 63, BSA) is an <strong><em>enabling</em></strong> provision to admit ‘computer output’ <em>(derived from original</em>)  as ‘document’ itself, in a simpler manner, by the <em><u>deeming</u></em> provision (“shall be deemed to be <strong>also</strong> a document”) <strong>‘<em>notwithstanding anything </em></strong><em>contained in the Act</em>’. That is, computer output (copy) can <strong>also</strong> be proved by any other manner provided for proving any other document.</li>
<li>Second, a computer output (copy) can be proved <span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>only</strong></span> under the provisions of Sec. 65 B, <strong>‘<em>notwithstanding anything </em></strong><em>contained in the Act</em>’. (It is the view taken by the Supreme Court in Arjun Panditrao v. Kailash Kushanrao,  2020-3 SCC 216.)</li>
</ul>
<p>The words in the new Sec. 61, “<strong><u>Nothing</u></strong> in this Adhiniyam <em><u>shall apply</u></em> to <strong>deny</strong> <strong>the admissibility</strong>” makes an emphatic delineation of the legislative intent on the following two matters –</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>1.</strong> Sec. 65B (Sec. 63, BSA) is an <strong><em>enabling</em></strong> provision to admit ‘computer output’ <em>(copy</em>)  by the  <em><u>deeming</u></em> provision <strong>‘<em>notwithstanding anything </em></strong><em>contained in the Act</em>’.</li>
<li><strong>2.</strong> The interpretation given to Sec. 65B that a ‘computer output (copy) can be proved only’ under the provisions of Sec. 65B, <strong> ‘<em>notwithstanding anything </em></strong><em>contained in the Act</em>’(the view taken in Arjun Panditrao v. Kailash Kushanrao, 2023 SCC 216), is not accepted by the legislature.
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li> “<strong>Nothing</strong> in this Adhiniyam <em><u>shall apply</u></em> to <strong>deny</strong> <strong>the admissibility</strong>” applies to Sec. 63 also. Therefore, the interpretation given in Arjun Panditrao v. Kailash Kushanrao, 2023 SCC 216, will not remain in force.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline">“<strong>Subject to Section 63</strong>”</span>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>The words, “<strong>subject to section 63</strong>” (BSA), in Section 61 (BSA), denotes two things-</li>
<li>1. Sec. 61 covers Sec. 63 also. That is, Sec. 61 is <span style="text-decoration: underline">not confined to (original)  ‘electronic record’</span>;  but it covers ‘computer output’ (copy) also.</li>
<li>2. To avoid a misinterpretation – that Sec. 61 is independent of Sec. 63 which directs to comply with certain requirements to accept ‘computer output’ (copy) (that is production of Sec. 63(4) certificate and HASH certificate etc.)  one opts to prove  ‘computer output’ (copy) under the provisions of Sec. 63.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Note: 1. If this interpretation is not given, Sec. 61 stands meaningless.</p>
<p>Note: 2. This interpretation is also necessary to give effect to the legislative intent (liberalization of evidence).</p>
<p>Note: 3. Invoking Sec. 61, a copy taken in a CD or pen-drive <sub>(which is obviously ‘made by mechanical processes which in itself insure the accuracy’)</sub> can be given in evidence, with the<span style="text-decoration: underline"> oral evidence</span> to the effect that it is the copy taken from the Electronic Record <sub>(original)</sub>. Now, because of Arjun Panditrao v. Kailash Kushanrao, 2023 SCC 216, we cannot give evidence in this manner; for, according to Arjun Panditrao ‘computer output <sub>(copy)</sub> can be proved only’ under the provisions of Sec. 65B, that is with the “Sec. 65B Certificate” <sub><strong>(‘<em>notwithstanding anything </em></strong><em>contained in the Act</em>’)</sub>.</p>

<p><strong><u><mark class="has-inline-color has-foreground-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Changes made to Sec. 65B</mark></u></strong></p>
<p>The proposed Bhartiya Sakshya Act, 2023 introduces significant changes in Sec. 65B of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872. It updates Sec. 65B, as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Now, under Sec. 65B of the Indian Evidence Act, copy or print-out of an electronic record can be proved only by producing the certificate provided under Sec. 65B(4), in view of the Supreme Court decision in Arjun Panditrao v. Kailash Kushanrao, 2020-3 SCC 216.  </li>
<li>The proposed Bhartiya Sakshya Act, 2023, (Sec. 63 read with Sec, 61) allows to prove the copy or print-out of an electronic record invoking other provisions of the Evidence Act (such as Sec. 63 and 65 IEA = Sec. 58 and 60 BSA) that permits to prove a secondary evidence (copy) of a document.</li>
<li>If  a computer output (copy) is sought to be proved invoking Sec. 63, Bhartiya Sakshya Act, 2023, the<strong> “<u>certificate (HASH) specified in the Schedule</u>” is necessary</strong>. It is to be produced “along with the electronic record” also.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><u>A Discordant Note</u></strong></p>
<p>The Certificate required in Sec. 63(4)(c) of the new Act must be “in the form specified in the Schedule”. It appears that this certificate is needed in addition to the Certificate that is required in sub-section (4) as regards the matters enumerated therein; or the Certificate should contain (additionally) the matters enumerated in sub-section (4).</p>
<p>The Form in the Schedule directs to state as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“I state that the HASH value/s of the electronic/digital record/s is …… ……… …… , obtained through the following algorithm –</li>
<li>SHA1:</li>
<li>SHA256:</li>
<li>MD5:</li>
<li>Other …….. …….. …….. (Legally acceptable standard)</li>
<li>(Hash report to be enclosed with the certificate)”</li>
</ul>
<p>The requirement for this certificate is unnecessary, especially in situations where there is no dispute regarding the computer output (copy or print-out). It may be more feasible for many litigants to bring the original device, such as a computer, laptop, or mobile phone, to court than to get the HASH value fixed through an expert.</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Note: Hash value is needed/possible in electronic evidence alone.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><u>What is HASH value</u> <u>(in simplest terms)</u>?</strong></p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>HASH value is a string of unique characters, usually represented by letters and numbers.</li>
<li>It is a scientific method (algorithm) commonly used to find out tampering, if any, on an electronic record.</li>
<li>HASH value of every electronic record can be fixed.</li>
<li>Any modification or change made thereto – no matter how small, even addition of a comma (,) – will result in a completely different hash value.</li>

<p>The proposed Bhartiya Sakshya Act, 2023 introduces <em><u>two</u></em> significant changes in Sec. 27 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872.</p>
<p><strong><u>Changes in the New Act</u></strong> (<strong>Made</strong> <strong>to Sec. 27, IEA)</strong></p>
<p>First –</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Now, from the words of Sec. 27 of the Indian Evidence Act, it is clear (i) what is to be proved by Sec. 27 is the fact deposed by the Investigating Officer in court; and (ii) it must be as to the ‘discovery’ on ‘information’ (or disclosure) from the accused.</li>
<li>From the words of Sec. 27 of the Evidence Act, it could be shown or argued (though not correct) that the fact ‘discovered’ embraces (a) the “recovery” (b) of the “object” (c) in the immediate presence of the accused – to have it “in consequence of (his) information”.</li>
<li>The possibility of these (incorrect) arguments are averted by removing the word “<strong><em><u>thereby</u></em></strong>” in Section 27 (in the proviso to Section 23 of the new Bhartiya Sakshya Act).</li>
</ul>
<p>Second –</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Now, the Sec. 27 of the Indian Evidence Act begins with a ‘Proviso’.</li>
<li>This impropriety is removed by clubbing Section 25, 26 and 27 (of the Indian Evidence Act) in the new  Bhartiya Sakshya Act (in Sec. 23).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><u>A Discordant Note</u></strong> </p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Now, under Sec. 25 of the Indian Evidence Act, no confession made to a police officer shall be proved as against a person accused of any offence. But, if it falls under Sec. 27 (that is, if it leads to a discovery as provided in Sec. 27), it can be proved.</li>
<li>Though Section 25 is retained in the new Bhartiya Sakshya Act, 2023, under Sec. 23(1), the proviso is not made applicable to the Section, 23(1).</li>
<li>Note: 1. The proviso is limited (or made applicable) to subsection (2) of Section 23 of the Bhartiya Sakshya Act (alone) – See the colon (:) at the end of subsection (2).</li>
<li>Note: 2. It appears to be a mistake in drafting the section; because,
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>(i) Sec. 25 of the Indian Evidence Act is a general provision which governs Sec. 26 also; and Sec. 27 applies to both Sec. 25 and 26;</li>
<li>(ii) but, the proviso in Sec. 23 of the Bhartiya Sakshya Act is made applicable to Sec. 23(2) alone, and not to Sec. 23(1); thereby the vigor of Sec. 23(1) prevails – without being governed by the Proviso to Section 23(2);</li>
<li>(iii) and, in such a case, Section 23(2) of the Bhartiya Sakshya Act, cannot work at all, inasmuch as Sec. 23(1) makes a total bar – “No confession made to a police officer shall be proved as against a person accused of any offence”.  </li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Sec. 27 Indian Evidence Act (Proviso to Sec. 23 Bhartiya Sakshya Act) Analysed</strong></span></p>
<p><strong><u>Who has to “depose”</u> </strong>– It is by the police officer, and before the court. </p>
<p><strong><u>What is to be Deposed</u></strong> – It is the fact he discovered as disclosed by the accused.</p>
<p>“<strong><u>As Discovered</u></strong>” (in consequence of information from accused)</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>It is the fact deposed to (as disclosed by the accused) by the police officer before the court. It should have been ‘discovered’ from the “<strong><u>Place</u></strong> of Concealment”.</li>
</ul>
<p>‘<strong><u>Fact discovered</u></strong>‘ <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">embraces Place of Concealment and Knowledge of Accused</span></strong></p>
<p>The classic Privy Council verdict, <strong>Pulukuri Kotayya v. King ­Emperor</strong>, AIR 1947 PC 67, consistently followed by the courts in India, made it clear, as regards the concealment of a knife, as under-</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“In their Lordships’ view it is fallacious to treat the “<strong>fact discovered</strong>” within the section as equivalent to the object produced; the fact discovered embraces the<strong> place</strong> <strong>from which the object is<u> produced</u></strong> and the <strong>knowledge of the accused</strong> <strong>as to this</strong>, and the information given must relate distinctly to this fact. Information as to past user, or the past history, of the object produced is not related to its discovery in the setting in which it is discovered. Information supplied by a person in custody that “I will produce a knife concealed in the roof of my house” does not lead to the discovery of a knife; knives were discovered many years ago. It leads to the discovery of the fact that a knife is concealed in the house of the informant to his knowledge; and if the knife is proved to have been used in the commission of the offence, the <strong><u>fact discovered</u></strong> is very relevant. If the statement of the accused contains the words ‘<em>with which I stabbed A’</em>, these words are inadmissible since they do not relate to the discovery of the knife in the house of the informant.”</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><u>‘Fact Discovered’ is the “Place to the Knowledge of the Accused”</u></strong></p>
<p>From Pulukuri Kotayya v. King ­Emperor it is clear –</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Even if the <em>knife was discovered many years ago</em>,</li>
<li>if the fact that the knife was concealed in a place (to the knowledge of the accused) is discovered,</li>
<li>it is relelvent and admissible under Sec. 27 Evd. Act.</li>
</ul>
