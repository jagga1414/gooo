<p><strong><u>PART   I – ABSTRACT</u></strong></p>
<p><strong>1. </strong>Courts in India consistently adhered to the following postulations-</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Prescriptive Right of Easement (Grant also) stands destructive to claim of Easement of Necessity. </li>
<li><mark class="has-inline-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#8108f2">Eas</mark><mark class="has-inline-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#9b51e0">e</mark><mark class="has-inline-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#7d0ae8">ment of <span style="text-decoration: underline">necessity</span> is based on <span style="text-decoration: underline">implied grant</span>. That is, it is based on some sort of </mark><mark class="has-inline-color has-primary-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">‘<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">consent</span></strong></mark> <mark class="has-inline-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#7d0ae8">or permission’. But, Easement by<span style="text-decoration: underline"> Prescription</span>  is acquired by prescriptive or</mark> <mark class="has-inline-color has-primary-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">hostile acts</span></strong>.</mark></li>
<li>Therefore, both such rights cannot be claimed in the (same) suit even as an alternative remedy.</li>
<li>Theoretical basis of ‘Easement of Necessity’ and ‘Easement by Implied Grant’ are same. Therefore, such claims can be raised in the (same) suit as an alternative remedy.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>2. </strong>Following is a matter of seminal importance-</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>A (Single) Judge of the Kerala High Court (in Achuthan Nair, v. Vasudevan, 2020-5 KHC 647) took the view that Easement of Necessity can be claimed as an alternative remedy (in a suit based on Prescriptive Rights),  “<mark class="has-inline-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#ff6900"><strong>in the event of rejection of claim of prescriptiv</strong></mark><strong><mark class="has-inline-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#ff6900">e</mark></strong> <strong><mark class="has-inline-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#ff6900">easement</mark></strong>“; <mark class="has-inline-color has-primary-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">for, easement of necessity is “co-extensive with the necessity”</mark>. It being stood against the earlier view of the High Court, in various cases, he referred the matter for the decision by a larger bench. The case is pending consideration by the larger Bench. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong><u>Necessity and Prescription (Generally Followed) Propositions</u></strong></p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Easement of Necessity and Prescriptive Right are ‘mutually destructive’</li>
<li>Both are antithetical to each other. </li>
<li>Both cannot be maintained in one suit.</li>
</ul>
<p>Invariably it is so held by the Courts in India. See:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>(i) P.  Sadayan v. Arumugam, 2020-1 LW 535</li>
<li>(vii) Lilly v. Wilson, (2018 (1) KLT 772 : 2018(1) KHC 623)</li>
<li>(vi) Kamala Devi Amma v. Rajan, (2017 (4) KLJ 700: 2017 KHC 876)</li>

</ul>
<p><strong><u><strong>Necessity and Implied Grant – can Claim Alternatively; Theoretical Basis Same</strong></u></strong></p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Theoretically, easement of necessity and quasi-easement arise from implied approval of the servient owner; and, therefore, there is “implied grant” in both.</li>
<li>‘Grant’ of easement may be express or implied. Implied grant is controlled by the (implied) terms and conditions of the grant.</li>
<li>Both easement of necessity and quasi easement have some common features; but, they are distinguishable and cannot go together.</li>
<li>Grant being controlled by the (implied) conditions, it is not akin to ‘quasi easement’, and a grant will not be defeated by the emergence of an alternative way.</li>
<li>It is obvious , the decision of <strong>Sree Swayam Prakash Ashramam v. G. Anandavally Amma</strong> , 2010 (2) SCC 689, proceeded on this principle – “theoretical basis of ‘Easement of Necessity’ and ‘Easement by (Implied) Grant’ are same”.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><u>Easement by Prescription</u></strong> <strong><u>and  <strong><u>Easement of Necessity </u></strong>are </u></strong><mark class="has-inline-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#cf2e2e"><strong><u>Antithetical</u></strong> </mark></p>
<p>Easement by prescription is “acquired” by <span style="text-decoration: underline">hostile and notorious acts</span>; but user of it should be peaceable and open enjoyment, without interruption for twenty years. Therefore, “grant” is <strong>‘</strong>presumed’ in easement by prescription.</p>
<p>Origin of Easements of necessity and Easement by prescription are different (<mark class="has-inline-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#8008f0">Easement of <span style="text-decoration: underline">necessity</span> is based on <span style="text-decoration: underline">implied grant</span>. <mark class="has-inline-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#7d0ae8">That is, it</mark> is based on some sort of ‘</mark><span style="text-decoration: underline"><mark class="has-inline-color has-primary-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">consent</mark></span><mark class="has-inline-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#8008f0"><span style="text-decoration: underline">,</span> approval or permission’. But, Easement by<span style="text-decoration: underline"> Prescription</span> is acquired by prescriptive or </mark><span style="text-decoration: underline"><mark class="has-inline-color has-primary-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">hostile acts</mark></span>). Hence, both these rights are said to be <strong><u>antithetical to each other</u></strong>. In Natesa Gounder v. Raja Gounder, 2012-5 Mad LW 649, it is observed as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“<strong>Implied grant</strong> and the concept easement by <strong>prescription</strong> are quite <span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>antithetical</strong> to each other</span>. If a person is having an implied grant in his favour, then the question of prescription would not arise.” (Quoted in: Kalyan Spinning Mills v. M.  Chellappan, AIR  2023 Mad 8, P.  Sadayan v. Arumugam, 2020-1 Mad LW 535).</li>
</ul>
<p>In Tanba Nusaji Mahajan v, Pandhari Mahajan, 2004 (6) BomCR 782, 2004 (4) MhLJ 109, it is held as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“10.    …. The <u>acquisition of way by <mark class="has-inline-color has-primary-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><strong>adverse user</strong></mark> is based upon the theory of the </u><strong><mark class="has-inline-color has-primary-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><u>hostility</u> </mark></strong>of the use to the title of the person over whose lands it is acquired, while a <u>way of <mark class="has-inline-color has-primary-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><strong>necessity</strong></mark> is based upon an implication of an</u><strong><u> <mark class="has-inline-color has-primary-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">intended</mark> <mark class="has-inline-color has-primary-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">grant</mark></u></strong> and the use of it is based entirely upon such implication or consent to its use.”</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>No Res judicata</strong>, <strong>Where suit dismissed on Technical Ground</strong></span></p>
<p>It is trite law – there will not be res judicata if a suit is dismissed not on merit but on technical ground. (See: Niloufer Siddiqui v. Indian Oil Corporation Ltd., AIR 2008 Patna 5 upheld by the Supreme Court in Indian Oil Corporation Ltd.  v. Niloufer Siddiqui, 2015-16 SCC 125:  Referred to in: P. Rajesh v. V. Shanthi, 2015-5 LW 27; 2015-7 MLJ 648)</p>
<p>Therefore, there may not be any bar on the ground of res judicata even if a suit is dismissed on the technical ground of claiming inconsistent pleas of easement.</p>

<p><strong><u>A Discordant, but Intriguing, Note</u></strong></p>
<p>Indicating forceful materials, the intricate legal principle as to ‘mutual destruction’ between Easement of Necessity and Prescriptive Right is doubted in Achuthan Nair v. Vasudevan, 2020-5 KHC 647; 2021-1 KLJ 24; 2020-6 KLT 104. It is found that a deeper examination and critical analysis are required, in light of the compelling circumstances. Hence the Single Bench of the Kerala High Court ordered a reference (to a larger bench), as shown above.</p>
<p><strong><u>PART   II – EASEMENT OF NECESSITY and PRESCRIPTION – ACCEPTED POSITION</u></strong> </p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">Antithetical to each other</span></strong></p>
<p>As shown above, in Natesa Gounder v. Raja Gounder, 2012-5 Mad LW 649, it is held as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“<span style="text-decoration: underline">Implied grant</span> and the concept easement by <span style="text-decoration: underline">prescription</span> are quite <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">antithetical to each other</span></strong>.”</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><u>Mutually Incongruous and Contradictory; <span style="text-decoration: underline">Cannot Operate Together</span></u></strong></p>
<p>In Lilly v. Wilson, (2018 (1) KLT 772 : 2018(1) KHC 623), it is held thus:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“14. A mistake commonly committed by the draftsmen is to plead both easement by prescription and easement of necessity together in respect of a way, forgetting the fact that they are <span style="text-decoration: underline">mutually<strong> incongruous</strong> to one another and <strong>contradictory</strong></span> in nature. S.15 of the Act deals with easement by prescription…………..”</li>
<li>17. It is therefore clear from the above principles that easement of necessity and easement by prescription <span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>cannot operate together</strong></span> in respect of any immovable property. This proposition has been settled in a number of decisions (see Mohammed v. Doomunhi Achari, 1987 KHC 649 : 1987(2) KLT 1037 : 1988(1) KLJ 442 : AIR 1988 Ker.298 : 1988(1) Cur.CC 486, Joy Joseph and others v. Jose Jacob alias Thankachan, 2010(4) KHC 167 and Kallen Devi v. Raghavan, 2012 (2) KHC 443 : 2012(3)KLT 142).”</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><u>Will Not Go Together</u></strong></p>
<p>In Kamala Devi Amma v. Rajan, (2017 (4) KLJ 700: 2017 KHC 876), the suit was dismissed finding, inter alia –</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>(i) ‘easement of <span style="text-decoration: underline">necessity and prescription <strong>will not go together</strong></span> the plaintiff has to elect one among them in order to claim the relief’; and</li>
<li>(ii) ‘in order to claim easement of <span style="text-decoration: underline">necessity</span>, mere statement that at one point of time the properties were under common owner alone is not sufficient and it must be specifically mentioned as to <span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>when</strong> the severance</span> has taken place <span style="text-decoration: underline">and the origin of easement</span> of necessity <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">arose</span> </strong>as well’.</li>
<li>(iii) “granting the relief of declaration of easement right of way by <span style="text-decoration: underline">prescription</span> in favour of the plaintiff that too for a <span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>lesser extent</strong></span> not for the extent claimed by the plaintiff in the plaint are <span style="text-decoration: underline">unsustainable in law</span>”.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><u>Contradictory and Inconsistent in Each Other</u></strong>;<strong><u> Both cannot Co-Exist</u></strong></p>
<p>In Kallen Devi v. Raghavan, (2012 (3) KLT 142 : 2012(2) KHC 443), it was held as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“First of all, the plea of prescriptive right of easement and easement of necessity are<span style="text-decoration: underline"> <strong>contradictory </strong>and<strong> inconsistent</strong> in each other</span>. <span style="text-decoration: underline">Both cannot co-exist</span>.”</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><u>Prescriptive Easement &amp; Necessity – to a Great Extent, Mutually Exclusive</u></strong></p>
<p>In Ibrahimkutty v. Abdul Rahmankunju (1992 KHC 443 : 1992(2) KLT 775 : 1992(2) KLJ 468: ILR 1993(1) Ker.331 : AIR 1993 Ker.91) it is held as follows:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“The qualitative and quantitative requirement for the different kinds of easement are to a <span style="text-decoration: underline">great extent mutually exclusive</span>”.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><u>ELECT ONE AMONG THEM</u></strong></p>
<p><strong><u>Elect From One Among Them</u></strong></p>
<p>In Kallen Devi v. Raghavan, (2012 (3) KLT 142 : 2012(2) KHC 443), it was held as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“Even assuming that the plaintiff is entitled to take <span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>inconsistent plea</strong>,</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline">at the <strong>time of evidence</strong></span> he has to <span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>elect</strong> from one among them </span>i.e. the prescriptive right of easement or easement by necessity and he cannot go on with both the pleas which are in fact <strong>contradictory.</strong> In the case on hand, the plaintiff pressed both the grounds and failed to establish prescriptive right of easement.”</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><u>Elect One Among Them</u></strong></p>
<p>In Kamala Devi Amma v. Rajan, (2017 (4) KLJ 700 : 2017 KHC 876) it is held as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“… The plaintiff has to <strong>elect </strong>one among them in order to claim the relief”.</li>

<p><strong><u>Opt One At the Time of Adducing Evidence</u></strong></p>
<p>In Lilly v. Wilson, (2018 (1) KLT 772 : 2018(1) KHC 623) it is held thus:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“… Therefore, I have no hesitation to hold that claims based on easement by prescription and easement of necessity taken up together in the pleadings by the respondent are <strong>contradictory </strong>to one another and therefore the plaintiff should have <strong>opted</strong> to adhere to one <span style="text-decoration: underline">at the time of adducing evidence</span>.”</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><u>Essential Legal Attributes of Easement of Necessity &amp; ‘Easement by Grant’</u></strong> </p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline">Hero Vinoth v.  Seshamm</span>al, 2006-5 SCC 545, is the well accepted authority, as regards <strong>‘easement of necessity and Grant’</strong>. As regards easement of necessity it is laid down as under –</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>An easement of necessity is one which is not merely necessary for the reasonable enjoyment of the dominant tenement, but one where dominant tenement cannot be used at all without the easement.</li>
<li>The burden of the servient owner in such a case is not on the basis of any concession or grant made by him for consideration or otherwise, but it is by way of a legal obligation enabling the dominant owner to use his land.</li>
<li>It is limited to the <u style="font-weight: bold">barest necessity</u> <strong><u>however inconvenient it is</u></strong> irrespective of the question whether a better access could be given by the servient owner or not. When an alternate access becomes available, the legal necessity of burdening the servient owner ceases and the easement of necessity by implication of law is legally withdrawn or extinguished as statutorily recognized in Sec. 41.</li>
<li>Such an easement will last only as long as the absolute necessity exists.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Hero Vinoth v.  Seshammal, 2006-5 SCC 545, </strong>laid down, as regards ‘easement by grant’, as under–</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>The grant may be express or even by necessary implication.</li>
<li>In either case it will not amount to an easement of necessity under Sec. 13 of the Act eventhough it may also be an absolute necessity for the person in whose favour the grant is made.</li>
<li>Limit of the easement acquired by grant is controlled only by the terms of the contract. If the terms of the grant restrict its user subject to any condition the parties will be governed by those conditions. Any how the scope of the grant could be determined by the terms of the grant between the parties alone.</li>
<li>If it is a permanent arrangement uncontrolled by any condition, that permanency in user must be recognized and the servient tenement will be recognized and the servient tenement will be permanently burdened with that disability.</li>
<li>Such a right does not arise under the legal implication of Sec. 13.</li>
<li> An easement by grant does not get extinguished under Sec. 41 of the Act which relates to an easement of necessity.</li>
<li>Where the parties clearly provided for a right of access to the backyard of the defendant’s house when the Partition deed was executed and shares were allotted to various sharers taking into account various factors, it is a matter of contractual arrangement between them.</li>
<li>In such a contract if a right of way is provided to a particular sharer, it cannot be extinguished merely because such sharer has other alternative way.</li>
</ul>
<p>Hero Vinoth v.  Seshammal, 2006-5 SCC 545, is the well accepted authority, to differentiate ‘easement of necessity and grant’. It is laid down–</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Easement of necessity is depended upon <strong><u>absolute necessity</u></strong>.  Easement by grant does not depend upon absolute necessity of it. (It is the nature of the acquisition that is relevant.)</li>
<li>Many easements acquired by grant may be absolutely necessary for the enjoyment of the dominant tenement in the sense that it cannot be enjoyed at all without it. That may be the reason for the grant also. Still, easement of grant is a <strong><u>matter of contract</u></strong> between the parties, and the parties are governed by the terms of the grant and not anything else; whereas easement of necessity is controlled under the legal implications of Sec. 13 and it is extinguished by the statutory provision under Sec. 41 (which is not applicable to easement by grant). The grant may be express or that arisen by necessary implication <strong><sub>(therefore controlled by Sec. 8)</sub></strong>.</li>
<li>In either case (express grant or grant arisen by implication) it <strong><u>will not amount to an easement of necessity</u></strong> under Sec. 13 even when grant is an absolute necessity for the person in whose favour it is made.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><u>Will Easement of Necessity Ripen into a Prescriptive Easement?</u></strong></p>
<p>In other words-</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Can one claim ‘easement of necessity’ and ‘easement by prescription’ with respect to a (same) way?  </li>
<li>Does a way  that started with minimum width (say a foot-path) under the claim ‘easement of necessity’, and continued, in the course of time, with a higher width (so that cars can be taken) for more than 20 years, yield or bring-in ‘easement by prescription’?</li>
</ul>
<p>We find answer in negative form in Tanba Nusaji Mahajan v, Pandhari Mahajan, 2004 (6) BomCR 782, 2004 (4) MhLJ 109. It is held as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>10. However, a way of necessity is distinguished from the right of way acquired by prescription and <strong><u>cannot ripen </u></strong><u>into a prescriptive easement so long as the necessity continues</u>. A way of necessity arises by virtue of <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">conditions entirely different</span></strong> from easement of way created by prescription. The former arises by implication of law out of the necessities of the case and is based upon principle of law which negative the existence of a way by continuous adverse user. The <u>acquisition of way by adverse user is based upon the <mark class="has-inline-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#eb1047"><strong>theory of the<span style="text-decoration: underline"> hostility</span></strong></mark></u> of the use to the title of the person over whose lands it is acquired, while a <strong><u>way of necessity is based upon an <mark class="has-inline-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#0d26e4">implication of an </mark><mark class="has-inline-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#252ff3">intended grant</mark></u></strong> and the use of it is based entirely upon such implication or consent to its use.”</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><u>PART   III – STAND-ALONE DECISION, ACHUTHAN NAIR v. VASUDEVAN</u></strong></p>
<p>The Single Bench of the Kerala High Court, in the reference-judgment (Achuthan Nair, v. Vasudevan, 2020-5 KHC 647; 2021-1 KLJ 24; 2020-6 KLT 104), raises an important question – so long as there is no other means of access to the dominant tenement, <strong>can’t easement of <span style="text-decoration: underline">necessity be raised as an alternative claim</span> t</strong>o right of prescriptive easement, <mark class="has-inline-color has-primary-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Easement of Necessity being co-extensive with the necessity</mark>. It reads as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“It is quite permissible to plead and raise an alternative remedy along with the main relief sought. By its nature, an <span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>easement of necessity</strong> would</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline">always stand as an</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong><mark class="has-inline-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#d95e06">alternative remedy</mark></strong></span><strong><mark class="has-inline-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#d95e06"> </mark></strong>in the absence of a means of access to the dominant tenement. In short, the incident of easement of necessity is not contemporaneous with that of an easement by grant or easement by prescription, but would act as an <mark class="has-inline-color has-foreground-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">alternative easement </mark>when absolute necessity comes out<mark class="has-inline-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#ff6900"> </mark><span style="text-decoration: underline"><mark class="has-inline-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#ff6900"><strong>in the event of rejection of claim of prescriptiv</strong></mark><strong><mark class="has-inline-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#ff6900">e</mark></strong> <strong><mark class="has-inline-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#ff6900">easement</mark></strong></span>, easement by grant or easement by lost grant etc.”</li>
</ul>
<p>The authoritative reasons pointed out by the Judge, for consideration of the larger Bench, can be summarised as under:  </p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>1.</strong> Easement of necessity continues as long as necessity exits (it is co-extensive with the necessity). Easement of necessity would act as an alternative easement when absolute <span style="text-decoration: underline">necessity comes out in the event of rejection of claim of prescriptive easement</span>, easement by grant etc.</li>
<li><strong>2.</strong> The easement of necessity will not extinguish except (as provided) under Sections 44, 45 and 46 of the Indian Easement Act (natural destruction, permanent alteration etc.)</li>
<li><strong>3.</strong> For the above, there will be no “mutual destruction” between ‘easement by grant’ and ‘easement of necessity’.</li>
<li><strong>4.</strong> From Sree Swayam Prakash Ashramam v. G. Anandavally Amma , 2010 (2) SCC 689, it can be “<strong>presumed</strong>” that “there cannot be any inconsistency or mutual destruction between an <strong><em><u>easement by grant</u></em></strong> or easement by implied grant <strong><em><u>with an easement of necessity</u></em></strong>”</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><u>1. Easement of Necessity is Co-Extensive With the Necessity</u></strong></p>
<p>‘B.B Katiyar On Law Of Easement And Licences’ reads as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“An easement of necessity is co-existent and co-extensive with the necessity.”</li>
</ul>
<p>Therefore, the reference order of Achuthan Nair, v. Vasudevan emphasised the important point – “<span style="text-decoration: underline"><mark class="has-inline-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#ef5c05"><strong>in the event of rejection of claim of prescriptive</strong> <strong>easement</strong></mark></span>“, Easement of Necessity can be claimed as an <mark class="has-inline-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#db6609"><strong>alternative</strong> claim</mark>, <mark class="has-inline-color has-primary-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">easement of necessity being co-extensive with the necessity</mark>. It is said as under-</p>

<li>“When there is no way available, virtually, the property would become incapable of enjoyment or to exercise any act of ownership over it. There lies the scope of an indefeasible incident annexed to the landed property as its integral part which <span style="text-decoration: underline">would act as an </span><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">alternative remedy when an absolute necessity comes out</span>.</strong> It cannot be defeated or extinguished so long as, the tenements which were severed-dominant and servient, are in existence. It is <span style="text-decoration: underline">not specified anywhere in the Indian Easement Act that an easement of necessity would remain inactive and inoperative when there is an alternative way</span> and would revive when absolute necessity arises. But the very <span style="text-decoration: underline">principle underlying easement of necessity giving rise an incident <strong>co-extensive with the land severed, </strong>on severance of tenements would<strong> </strong>show that it will not extinguish under Section 47 of the Indian Easement Act</span>.”</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><u>2. No Extinction except under S. 44, 45 and 46, Indian Easement Act</u></strong></p>
<p>Apart from the law that easement of necessity continues as long as necessity exits, it is not extinguished otherwise than as provided in the Easement Act (also). The relevant provision of law as to extinction of Easement is laid down in  Sections 44, 45 and 46 of the Indian Easement Act (natural destruction, permanent alteration etc.).</p>
<p>Katiyar says as to the same as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“According to Section 47 of the Act there cannot be any extinction of easement, which has been used by way of necessity. <span style="text-decoration: underline">There could not be any extinguishment of easement of necessity</span>, merely because of the reason of non-mention of the same in the documents or an omission made. (R. Prabakaran v. Ambujathammal 2004 (3) LW 240)”</li>
</ul>
<p>Quoting above passages of Katiyar, it is observed by the High Court (Achuthan Nair, v. Vasudevan, 2020-5 KHC 647; 2021-1 KLJ 24; 2020-6 KLT 104), as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“This would make the legal position crystal clear that a coextensive and coexistent incident – the easement of necessity – <span style="text-decoration: underline">will not extinct</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline">or extinguish except under Sections 44, 45 and 46</span> of the Indian Easement Act …..”</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><u>3. No “Mutual Destruction” between <strong><u><em>‘easement of necessity</em>’</u></strong> and <strong><u>‘<em>grant’</em> </u></strong><em> </em></u></strong></p>
<p>There will be no “mutual destruction” between ‘easement by grant’ and ‘easement of necessity’ for the above two reasons; that is –</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>1. Easement of necessity continues as long as necessity exits.</li>
<li>2. The easement of necessity will not extinguish except under Sections 44, 45 and 46 of the Indian Easement Act (natural destruction, permanent alteration etc.)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><u>4. Sree Swayam Prakash Ashramam v. G. Anandavally Amma</u></strong></p>
<p>The High Court then referred to Sree Swayam Prakash Ashramam v. G.Anandavally Amma , AIR 2010 SC 622: 2010 (2) SCC 689, observing as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“11. In Sree Swayam Prakash Ashramam and Ors. v. G. Anandavally Amma and Ors. (MANU/SC/0010/2010), both the claim of easement of necessity and easement of grant came up for consideration by way of a suit for declaration of easement of necessity or of grant and a permanent prohibitory injunction.”</li>
</ul>
<p>The High Court splendidly pointed out the following from the Apex Court decision –</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>The Apex Court accepted the finding of the High Court regarding existence of implied grant and found that it would not be necessary to deal with the decision on easement of necessity which necessarily involves an absolute necessity.</li>
<li>Though the ingredients which would constitute easement of grant (or implied grant) and easement of necessity are different and cannot reconcile themselves,</li>
<li>and (there may be) embargo in maintaining a suit for easement by grant (or implied grant) along with a relief of easement of necessity</li>
<li>or inconsistency in maintaining both the claims at the same time</li>
<li>(they) were <em><u>not taken up</u></em>, <strong><em><u>“presumably </u></em></strong><em><u>on the reason that</u></em> there <strong>cannot be any inconsistency</strong> or mutual destruction between an <em><u>easement by </u></em><strong><em><u>grant</u></em> </strong>or easement by implied grant <em><u>with an easement of <strong>necessity</strong></u></em>.”</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><u>Swayam Prakash Case Did Not Consider the Doctrine –  ‘Mutually Destructive</u></strong>‘</p>
<p>Sree Swayam Prakash Ashramam v. G.Anandavally Amma is a classic decision on ‘easement by implied grant’.</p>
<p>In that case, plaintiff claimed “easement of necessity or of grant”.</p>
<p>Though the plaintiff pleaded only ‘Grant’(and not Implied Grant), the Apex Court allowed ‘Implied Grant’, observing by the Apex Court as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“It is true that the defendant/appellant alleged that <span style="text-decoration: underline">no implied grant was pleaded</span> in the plaint. The Trial Court, in our view, was justified in holding that such <span style="text-decoration: underline">pleadings were not necessary when<strong> it did not make a difference</strong> to the finding </span>arrived at <span style="text-decoration: underline">with respect to the easement by way of grant</span>. Accordingly, there is no substance in the argument raised by the learned senior counsel for the appellants.”</li>
</ul>
<p>Therefore, the Kerala High Court precisely observed it can be “<strong>presumed”</strong> that <strong><em>‘</em></strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">there cannot be any inconsistency or mutual destruction</span> between an <em><u>easement by gr</u></em><span style="text-decoration: underline"><em><u>ant</u></em> </span>or easement by implied grant <em><u>with an easement of necessity</u>’<strong>.</strong></em></p>
<p><strong><u>Conclusion</u></strong></p>
<p>Inasmuch as </p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>(i) it is a fact that the courts in India consistently followed the principle that the easement of necessity and easement by prescription are mutually destructive claims (<mark class="has-inline-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#8000f9">because</mark>, <mark class="has-inline-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#8108f2">Eas</mark><mark class="has-inline-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#9b51e0">e</mark><mark class="has-inline-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#7d0ae8">ment of <span style="text-decoration: underline">necessity</span> is based on <span style="text-decoration: underline">implied grant</span> – based on some sort of </mark><mark class="has-inline-color has-primary-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">‘<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">consent</span></strong>, </mark><mark class="has-inline-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#7d0ae8">approval or permission’; and, Easement by<span style="text-decoration: underline"> Prescription</span>  is acquired by prescriptive or</mark> <mark class="has-inline-color has-primary-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">hostile acts</span></strong></mark><mark class="has-inline-color has-foreground-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">)</mark>; and  </li>
<li>(ii) the Supreme Court, in Sree Swayam Prakash Ashramam v. G.Anandavally Amma , AIR 2010 SC 622, did not consider this point, </li>
</ul>
<p>the ensuing decision (in the reference to larger bench made by the single judge) in  Achuthan Nair, v. Vasudevan, 2020-5 KHC 647 is of seminal importance.</p>
