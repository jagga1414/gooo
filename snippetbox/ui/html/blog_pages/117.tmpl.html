<p><strong><u>Introduction</u></strong></p>
<p>Notaries derive authority to do various notarial-acts from Sec. 8 of the Notaries Act, 1952.</p>
<p>This section lays down the functions of notaries. It includes—“verify, authenticate, certify or attest the execution of any instrument”.<a href="#_ftn1">[1]</a></p>
<p><strong><u>Presumption of <span class="uppercase">r</span>egularity under Sec. 114 of Evidence Act</u></strong></p>
<p>Presumption of regularity is attached to ‘official acts’, under Sec. 114 of Evidence Act. By virtue of Sec. 8 of the Notaries Act, attestation of the notary public is also an ‘official act’.  Therefore, it is held in Jugraj Singh v. Jaswant Singh [AIR 1971 SC 761: 1970 SCC (2) 386] by our Apex Court (Hidayatullah, CJ, AN Ray, ID Dua, JJ) as under:</p>
<pre class="wp-block-preformatted has-small-font-size">“There is a presumption of regularity of official acts and we are satisfied that he (notary) must have satisfied himself in the discharge of his duties that the person who was executing it was the proper person. This makes the second power of attorney valid and effective both under s. 85 of the Indian Evidence Act and s. 33 of the Indian Registration Act.”</pre>
<p><strong><u>Copy</u></strong><strong><u> Attestation</u></strong></p>
<p>In Prataprai Trumbaklal Mehta v. Jayant Nemchand Shah, AIR 1992 Bom 149, the Bombay High Court has pointed out that Rule 10(1) of the Notaries Rules, 1956 prescribed fees for certifying copies of documents as true copies of the original at the rate set forth therein; and that the ‘copy attestation’ of a document made by a notary public was also an official act. Here also, the Bombay High Court, cautioned that the notary must have properly discharged his duty by making due entry in the notary register etc. It is observed in this decision as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“Notarised copies of power of attorney and other documents are filed with Banks, Courts and other public institutions. If documents are marked as true copy by the notary without taking due care and even making any entry in the notary register and without taking signature of an advocate identifying the executant or without taking other reasonable precaution, it cannot be said that the notary is discharging his duty in accordance with law as expected of him.”</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><u>Presumption as to Powers-of-Attorney</u></strong></p>
<p>Sections 85 Sec. 114 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 are germane. Under Sec. 85 there is a presumption as to the authority of the Notary Public. That is, if a document contains the seal and signature of a notary public (including foreign countries like USA, UK, Canada) it is presumed to be genuine; and therefore no further evidence need be produced before the court to prove the seal and signature.</p>
<p>Section 85 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 reads as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>85. <span style="text-decoration:underline">Presumption as to powers-of-attorney.</span>—The Court shall presume that every document purporting to be a power-of-attorney, and to have been executed before, and authenticated by, a Notary Public, or any Court, Judge, Magistrate,  Indian Consul or Vice-Consul, or representative of the Central Government, was so executed and authenticated.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong><u>The Presumption is Presumption as to Genuineness</u></strong></p>
<p>In Rajeshwarhwa vs Sushma Govil: AIR 1989 Delhi 144,  it is held that the presumption is with respect to attestation by a ‘Competent Notary’ . It reads as under:</p>
<pre class="wp-block-preformatted has-small-font-size" id="block-7c0d1340-a777-408c-9702-d86071b8cc2b">"When a seal of the Notary is put on the document, Sec. 57 of the Evidence Act (courts take judicial notice)comes into play and a presumption can be raised regarding the genuineness of the seal of the said Notary, meaning thereby that the said document is presumed to have been attested by a competent Notary of that country."</pre>
<p>Further, Sec. 85 of the Indian Evidence Act provides that the Court shall presume that a power of attorney executed before a Notary Public was duly ‘executed’. The <span style="text-decoration:underline">presumption drawn is the presumption as to genuineness</span> of (i) its execution, including (ii) identification of its executant. But, it is a rebuttable presumption. In Prataprai Trumbaklal Mehta v. Jayant Nemchand Shah: AIR 1992 Bom 149, it was observed as under:</p>
<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">“Law takes judicial notice of seal of a notary. In ordinary course, an initial presumption may be made about genuineness of the notarised copy of the document. The underlying idea behind such presumption is that the notary is normally a responsible member of the legal profession and he is expected to take due care to satisfy himself about the identity of the party appearing before him.”</pre>

<p><strong><u>Course to be adopted if the<span class="uppercase"> p</span>arty is <span class="uppercase">n</span>ot <span class="uppercase">k</span>nown to the <span class="uppercase">n</span>otary</u></strong></p>
<p>When the party appearing before the notary is not known to the notary, the aforesaid decision Prataprai Trumbaklal Mehta v. Jayant Nemchand Shah: AIR 1992 Bom 149, points out the remedy as under: </p>
<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">“If the party appearing before the notary is not known to the notary, the notary must get the party identified by an Advocate known to him and take signature of both of them in token thereof.”</pre>
<p><strong><u>The presumption is presumption as to ‘Authentication’ also</u></strong></p>
<p>S. 85 of the Indian Evidence Act provides that the Court shall presume that a power of attorney was duly ‘authenticated’ by the Notary Public, also. It is pointed out in Kamla Rani v. M/S. Texmaco: AIR 2007 Delhi 147, that the expression ‘shall presume’ in  Section 85  shows that the section is mandatory and that it is well settled that ‘authentication’ would mean more than mere execution.</p>
<p>As stated above, presumption of regularity of official acts can also be invoked and the court can come to a conclusion that the notary public was satisfied himself that the person purported himself had been executed it.</p>
<p>But, the certificate or endorsement of the notary public must apparently show that the notary public had satisfied himself, expressly or impliedly, about the identity of the person executed the document, though there was no prescribed form of authentication.<a href="#_ftn2">[2]</a> In Prataprai Trumbaklal Mehta v. Jayant Nemchand Shah: AIR 1992 Bom 149, the Bombay High Court cautioned that the notary must have properly discharged his duty by making due entry in the notary register and observing other reasonable precautions. </p>
<p><strong><u>Ratification of Earlier Act</u></strong></p>
<p>In  Jugraj Singh v. Jaswant Singh [AIR 1971 SC 761 1970 SCC (2) 386] it was found that the recital in a second power of attorney correcting the mistake in the first one, relates back to the original act  – done after first power of attorney and before the second one – on the basis of the first power of attorney.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration:underline">Unstamped documents</span></strong></p>
<p>Sec. 35 of the Indian Stamp Act, 1899 directs that no instrument chargeable with duty shall be admitted in evidence for any purpose by any person having by law or consent of parties authority to receive evidence, or <span style="text-decoration:underline">shall be acted upon</span>, registered or <span style="text-decoration:underline">authenticated by any such person or by any public officer</span>, unless such instrument is duly stamped (See: V.  Madhusudhan Rao v. S.  Nirmala Bai, AIR 2019 AP  93). </p>
<p><strong><u>Attestation of Will by Notary</u></strong></p>
<p>Sec. 8 (1) of the Notaries Act allows a notary to “verify, authenticate, certify or attest the execution of any instrument”.</p>
<p>Besides, authorising a Notary, inter alia, to ‘attest’ under Sec. 8 of the Notaries Act, Rule 11(8) of Notary Rules provides for the ‘preparation of a Will’, too.   Rule 11(8) reads as under:</p>
<pre class="wp-block-preformatted has-small-font-size">“(8) The notary may:
(1) draw, attest or certify documents under his official seal including conveyance of properties;
(2) note and certify the general transactions relating to negotiable instruments;
(3) <span style="text-decoration:underline">prepare a Will</span> or other testamentary documents; and
(4) prepare and take affidavits for various purposes for his notarial acts.”</pre>
<p>Therefore, if the notary public is merely ‘verifying, authenticating or certifying” the Will (other than ‘attesting’ the execution of the will), there must be two other proper “attesting witnesses” to the Will, as stipulated under Sec. 63 of the Succession Act. In other words, if the notary is an ‘attester’ of the Will, it must be clearly specified.</p>
<p>Section 63 (c) of the Indian Succession Act, 1925 reads as under:</p>
<pre class="wp-block-preformatted has-small-font-size">“The Will shall be attested by two or more witnesses, each of whom has seen the testator sign or affix his mark to the …..; and each of the witnesses shall sign the Will in the presence of the testator, but it shall not be necessary that more than one witness be present at the same time, and no particular form of attestation shall be necessary.</pre>
<p><strong><u>Conclusion: No Presumption – in Doubtful Documents</u></strong> </p>
<p>Presumption attached to the ‘official acts’ is rebuttable, under Sec. 144 of the Evidence Act.</p>
<p>In Thiyagarajan v. Muthusamy Gounder, 2013-3 Mad LJ 159, one of the attesting witnesses of the disputed Will was a Notary Public.  There were doubtful circumstances as to the execution of the Will. It was pointed out that ‘in doubtful cases, there is no presumption in favour of the Will (In dubiis non praesumitur pro testamento)’ though it is otherwise for the documents other than Will.</p>
<p>The Madras High Court, in this judgment, remanded the case with the following observation – “One more opportunity could be given to the plaintiff to dislodge the presumption attached to Ex.B2-the notary attested Will”.</p>
