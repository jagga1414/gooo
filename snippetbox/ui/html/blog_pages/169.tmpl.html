<p><strong><u>Saji Koduvath, Advocate, Kottayam.</u></strong></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline">Introduction</span></p>
<p>Effect of marking a document, without formal proof, on admission (or without objection), is a matter of controversy.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-table is-style-regular"><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>First view</strong></td><td>Admission of contents &amp; it dispenses with proof  (as to truth).</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Second View</strong></td><td>Admission of contents – but, does not dispense with proof.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Third view</strong></td><td>If <em><u>truth is in issue</u></em>, mere proof of contents, or marking without objection, is not proof of truth.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Fourth view</strong></td><td>Admission of contents, dispenses with proof and truth; but its <em><u>probative value</u></em> will be a matter for appreciation by court.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Fifth view</strong></td><td>Court should <em><u>require</u></em> (in proper cases) the party producing the document to adduce proper evidence, and to cure formal defects.</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>
<p><strong><u>1. Marked Without Objection – its ‘Contents’ stand Proved</u></strong></p>
<p><strong>When a document is marked without Objection Proof of execution is enough; and no separate proof is needed:</strong> Admission or exhibiting of documents in evidence and proving the same before the court are two different processes. In certain cases, as comes out from Sec. 56, 57 and 58 of the Evidence Act, when a document is admitted, separate proof need not be warranted. Similarly, separate proof may not be required when presumptions can be invoked, also (e.g. document in ordinary course of business, a letter obtained in reply).</p>
<p><strong>Secondary-evidence</strong>: Admission of contents of documents arises in two ways:</p>
<ol class="wp-block-list" style="list-style-type:1">
<li>documents in original</li>
<li>(by way) of secondary evidence.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Factual foundation to give secondary evidence must be established</strong>:   The party has to lay down the factual foundation to establish the right to give secondary evidence where the original document cannot be produced [Rakesh MohindraVs. Anita Beri: 2015AIR(SCW) 6271].</p>
<p><strong>Secondary-evidence</strong> <strong>–</strong> <strong>Marked Without Objection</strong>: When the party gives in evidence a certified-copy/secondary-evidence without proving the circumstances entitling him to give secondary evidence, the opposite party must raise his objection ((if he has)) at the time of admission of such documents. In case, objection is not raised at that point of time, he is precluded from raising it at a belated stage. It stands waived. [<strong>Kaliya Vs. State of MP:</strong> 2013-10 SCC 758]</p>
<p><strong>‘Contents’ stand proved:</strong> When a document is marked without objection, its ‘contents’ stand proved. See: <strong>RVE Venkatachala Gounder Vs. Arulmigu Viswesaraswami</strong>: AIR 2003  SC  4548. See also:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">

<li>Oriental Insurance Co Vs. Premlata:  (2007) 8 SCC 575</li>
<li>Thimmappa Rai v. Ramanna Rai,(2007) 14 SCC 63</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><u>2. Mere marking– not dispense with proof</u></strong> <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">(of truth of contents)</span></strong></p>
<p>In <strong>Sait Tarajee Khimchand v. Yelamarti Satyam</strong>, AIR 1971 SC 1865, the Supreme Court observed that mere marking of a document (day book or ledger) as an exhibit does not dispense with proof. In <strong>Nandkishore Lalbhai Mehta Vs. New Era Fabrics</strong>, AIR 2015 SC 3796, it is observed that mere marking as exhibit and identification of executor’s signature by one of witnesses do not prove contents of a document.</p>
<p>In <strong><em>Kaliya Vs. State of Madhya Pradesh</em></strong><em> (</em>2013-10 SCC 758) it is held as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“Mere admission of a document in evidence does not amount to its proof. Nor, mere marking of exhibit on a document does not dispense with its proof, which is otherwise required to be done in accordance with law. (Vide: The Roman Catholic Mission Vs. The State, AIR 1966 SC 1457; Marwari Khumhar Vs. Bhagwanpuri Guru Ganeshpuri AIR 2000 SC 2629; RVE Venkatachala Gounder Vs. Arulmigu AIR 2003 SC 4548; Smt. Dayamathi Bai Vs. K.M. Shaffi, AIR 2004 SC 4082; and LIC of India  Vs. Rampal Singh Bisen,2010-4 SCC 491).”</li>
<li>“The court is obliged to examine the <strong>probative value</strong> of documents produced in court or their contents and decide the question of admissibility of a document in secondary evidence.”</li>
<li>[Note: Further held: “In case, an objection is not raised at that point of time, it is precluded from being raised at a belated stage.”]</li>
</ul>
<p>Dibakar Behera v. Padmabati Behera, AIR 2008 Ori 92, it is observed <strong>[</strong>referring RVE Venkatachala Gounder Vs. Arulmigu Viswesaraswami, AIR 2003  SC  4548, Dayamati Bai Vs. K.M. Shaffi, 2004 SC 4082, Bhagyarathi Das v. Agadhu Charan Das, 62 (1986) CLT 298,  Budhi Mahal v. Gangadhar Das, 46 (1978) CLT 287 etc.<strong>]</strong> that a close reading of the above judicial pronouncements would show that whenever a document is marked as exhibit without objection, it will be presumed that the party having right of objection has waived formal proof of the document and in such situation, the entire contents of the document would be admissible in evidence. However, by such admission of document, the truth and correctness of the contents by itself would not be established and there must be some evidence to support the contents of such document.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">Secondary evidence</span></strong> relating to the contents of a document is inadmissible, until the non-production of the original is accounted for. The secondary evidence must be authenticated by foundational evidence that the alleged copy is in fact a true copy of the original. Mere admission of a document in evidence does not amount to its proof. Therefore, the documentary evidence is required to be proved in accordance with law.</p>
<p>In certain decisions a strong view has been taken – that there is obligation upon the courts to decide the question of admissibility of the secondary evidence of the documents produced, before making it by the proper endorsement thereon. [H. Siddiqui Vs. A. Ramalingam: AIR 2011 SC 1492; Nandkishore Lalbhai Mehta Vs. New Era Fabrics: AIR  2015  SC 3796]</p>
<p>In Rakesh Mohindra Vs. Anita Beri [2015 AIR(SCW) 6271] it is held:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“Mere admission of secondary evidence, does not amount to its proof. The genuineness, correctness and existence of the document shall have to be established during the trial and the trial court shall record the reasons before relying on those secondary evidences.”</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><u>3. IF ‘TRUTH’ IS IN ISSUE- Mere Marking Not Amounts to ‘Waiver’</u></strong></p>
<p>The fundamental principles as to proof of execution a document is that the execution has to be proved by admissible evidence, that is by the ‘evidence of those persons who can vouchsafe for the truth of the facts in issue’ (<em>Narbada Devi Gupta v. Birendra Kumar Jaiswal, 2003-8 SCC 745).</em> But, in the facts and circumstances of each case, the court is at liberty to invoke its wisdom and fill certain gaps in evidence by applying ‘presumption’.</p>
<p>It is legitimate to say that this requirement as to proof of ‘truth’ is independent from inviting  ‘proof of signature and handwriting’ in  Sec. 67 to 71  of the Evidence Act.  This proposition is clear from Sec. 67, which lays down the fundamental principles as to the proof of documents. Sec. 67 reads as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“67. <span style="text-decoration: underline">Proof of signature and handwriting of person alleged to have signed or written document produced</span>—If a document is alleged to be signed or to have been written wholly or in part by any person, the signature or the handwriting of so much of the document as is alleged to be in that person’s handwriting must be proved to be in his handwriting.”</li>
</ul>
<p>Though proof of execution (dealt with in Sec. 67 to 71) is independent from proof as to ‘truth’ of contents of a document, proof as to ‘truth’ can be presumed by the court, in most cases, on ‘proof of execution’. It is more so, when a document is admitted without objection. Proof as to ‘truth’ is essential if ‘truth’ is in issue, or in dispute. It rarely occurs. </p>
<p><strong>If ‘TRUTH’ is in issue, or in dispute,</strong> <em>marking a document without objection, or mere proof of handwriting or execution</em>,<em> </em>by itself, need not absolve the duty to prove the truth as to the contents of the documents. (<strong>Ramji Dayawala Vs. Invest Import</strong>, AIR 1981 SC 2085; Achuthan Pillai vs Marikar (Motors) Ltd., AIR 1983 Ker 81; Suresh v. Tobin, 2013-1 KerLT 293). Court has a duty to see that the statement of a witness gets independent corroboration, direct or circumstantial, in proper cases (Ahalya Bariha v. Chhelia Padhan, 1992 Cri.LJ 493).</p>
<p>In <strong>Ramji Dayawala Vs. Invest Import</strong>: AIR 1981 SC 2085, it us held as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“If the truth of the facts stated in a document is in issue mere proof of the handwriting and execution of the document would not furnish evidence of the truth of the facts or contents of the document. The truth or otherwise of the facts or contents so stated would have to be proved by admissible evidence, i.e. by the evidence of those persons who can vouchsafe for the truth of the facts in issue.”</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="text-decoration:underline"><strong>Photocopy of Public Document Marked Without Objection</strong></span></p>
<p>In<strong> Kalita Iqbal Basith  v. N Subbalakshmi, (2021) 2 SCC 718</strong>, our Apex Court considered admission of a <span style="text-decoration:underline">photocopy</span> of an official document, in the following factual matrix:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li class="has-small-font-size">The failure to produce the originals or certified copies of other documents was properly explained as being untraceable after the death of the brother of P.W.1 who looked after property matters. </li>
<li class="has-small-font-size">The attempt to procure certified copies from the municipality was also unsuccessful as they were informed that the original files were not traceable. </li>
<li class="has-small-font-size"><strong>The <span style="text-decoration:underline">photocopies were marked as exhibits without objection</span>.</strong> </li>
<li class="has-small-font-size"><span style="text-decoration:underline">The respondents never questioned the <strong>genuineness</strong> of the same</span>. </li>
<li class="has-small-font-size">Despite the aforesaid, and the fact that these <strong>documents were more than 30 years old</strong>, were produced from the proper custody of the appellants along with an explanation for non­production of the originals, they were rejected (by the High Court) without any valid reason holding that there could be no presumption that documents executed by a public authority had been issued in proper exercise of statutory powers.</li>
</ul>
<p>In this premises the Supreme Court held as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“This finding in our opinion is clearly perverse in view of <span style="text-decoration:underline">Section 114(e)</span> of the Indian Evidence Act 1872, which provides that <span style="text-decoration:underline">there shall be a presumption that all official acts have been <strong>regularly performed</strong></span>. The onus lies on the person who disputes the same to prove otherwise.”</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><u>4. Admission of Contents</u> – <u>May Dispense with Proof</u>; <u>But <em>Probative Value</em> may be Less or Nil</u></strong></p>
<p><strong>Court Examines Probative Value of Secondary Evidence</strong>: It is well settled that if a party wishes to lead secondary evidence, the Court is obliged to examine the probative value of the document produced in the Court or their contents and decide the question of admissibility of a document in secondary evidence [<strong>Rakesh Mohindra Vs. Anita Beri:</strong> 2015  AIR(SCW) 6271].</p>
<p>Contents of the document cannot be proved by mere filing the document in a court. Under the Law of Evidence, it is necessary that contents of documents are required to be proved either by primary or by secondary evidence. Mere marking a document as an ‘exhibit’ will not absolve the duty of to prove the documents in accordance with the provisions of the Evidence Act. At the most, marking ‘exhibit’may amount to proof of contents, but not its truth.</p>
<p>Documents which are not produced and marked as required under the Evidence Act cannot be relied upon by the Court. [See: <strong>LIC Vs. Ram Pal Singh Bisen</strong>: 2010-4 SCC 491 (Filing of the Inquiry Report or the evidence adduced during the domestic enquiry); <strong>M. Chandra Vs. M. Thangamuthu. Nandkishore Lalbhai Mehta Vs. New Era Fabrics</strong>: AIR 2015 SC 3796; <strong>Birad Mal SinghviVs. Anand Purohitb</strong>: 1988 (Supp) SCC 604 (date of birth)]</p>
<p>Even when a document is technically admitted in court, the probative value thereof will always be a matter for the court to determine. That is, it is depended upon the nature of each case. The probative value of Scene-Mahazar, Postmortem Report, photocopy of a Registered Deed etc. without supporting legal evidence may be lesser. In such cases the court can refrain from acting upon such documents until regular evidence is tendered.</p>
<p>As shown earlier, in <strong><em>Kaliya Vs. State of MP</em></strong><em>: 2013-10 SCC 758</em> (relying on  H. Siddiqui Vs. A. Ramalingam: AIR 2011 SC 1492, and Rasiklal Manikchand  Vs. MSS Food Products: 2012-2 SCC 196) held as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“The court is obliged to examine the <strong>probative value</strong> of documents produced in court or their contents and decide the question of admissibility of a document in secondary evidence.”</li>
</ul>
<p>[Note: Further held: “<em>In case, an objection is not raised at that point of time, it is precluded from being raised at a belated stage</em>.”]</p>
<p>In <em>Life Insurance Corporation of India Vs. Ram Pal Singh Bisen [</em>2010-4 SCC 491]<em>, it is </em>observed as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“26. We are of the firm opinion that mere admission of document in evidence does amount to its proof. In other words, mere marking of exhibit on a document does dispense with its proof, which is required to be done in accordance with law. …..27. It was the duty of the appellants to have proved documents Exh.-A-1 to Exh. A-10 in accordance with law. Filing of the Inquiry Report or the evidence adduced during the domestic enquiry would partake the character of admissible evidence in Court of law. That documentary evidence was also required to be proved by the appellants in accordance with the provisions of the Evidence Act, which they have failed to do.”</li>
</ul>
<p>The Calcutta High Court quoting Life Insurance Corporation of India Vs. Ram Pal Singh Bisen [2010-4 SCC 491] it is observed in Bajaj Allianz General Insurance Company Vs.Smt. Santa (2019-2 ACC 36) that ‘<em>even if the document had been marked as Exhibit-A without objection, <u>without a formal proof </u>thereof in accordance with the provisions of the Evidence Act, such document lost its credibility and is of<u> no probative value</u></em>’.</p>
<p>In Kalyan Singh, Vs. Chhoti  (AIR 1990  SC 396) it is observed as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><em>“</em>A certified copy of a registered sale deed may be produced as secondary evidence in the absence of the original. But in the present case Ex. 3 is not certified copy. It is just an ordinary copy. There is also no evidence regarding content of the original sale deed. Ex.3 cannot therefore, be considered as secondary evidence. The appellate Court has a right and duty to exclude such evidence.”</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration:underline">Document More Than 30 Years Old</span></strong></p>
<p>Sec. 90 CPC, as regards 30-year-documents, in the main, speaks about two things:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>A document purports to be in the handwriting of any particular person is <u>presumed to be in his handwriting</u>.</li>
<li>2. A document purports to be executed or attested is <u>presumed to be</u> <u>duly executed and attested</u>.</li>
</ul>
<p>But, if the document is a public document presumption (as to correctness) under Section 114(e) can be invoked. See: Kalita Iqbal Basith v. N Subbalakshmi, (2021) 2 SCC 718.</p>
<p><strong><u>Under Sec. 90,</u> <u>Presumption of Genuineness alone Established</u></strong></p>
<p>Under Sec. 90, not truth of contents, but, only presumption of genuineness of a document (ie. existence or handwriting), is drawn. Therefore, besides TRUTH, the contents of the documents also have to be proved by cogent evidence.</p>
<p>In Lakhi Baruah v. Padma Kanta Kalita, (1996) 8 SCC 357, AIR 1996 SC 1253, with regard to admissibility in evidence of thirty years old documents produced from proper custody, it was observed as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“15. Section 90 of the Evidence Act, 1872 is founded on necessity and convenience because it is extremely difficult and sometimes not possible to lead evidence to prove handwriting, signature  or execution of old documents after lapse of thirty years. In order to obviate such difficulties or improbabilities to prove execution of an old document, Section 90 has been incorporated in the Evidence Act, 1872 which does away with the strict rule of proof of private documents. Presumption of <strong>genuineness</strong> may be raised if the documents in question is produced from proper custody. It is, however, the discretion of the court to accept the presumption flowing from Section 90. There is, however, no manner of doubt that judicial discretion under Section 90 should not be exercised arbitrarily and not being informed by reasons.”</li>

<p><strong>5.</strong> <strong><u>Court should <em>allow</em> to adduce proper evidence to prove documents</u></strong></p>
<p>As stated in detail above, besides the powers of the court under Sec. 165 of Evidence Act, the scheme of the Procedural Acts shows that the court has jurisdiction to require the party concerned to prove that document. (Sec. 58 of Evidence Act and Order XII, Rule 2A Proviso of the CPC and Sec. 294 of the CrPC).</p>
<p>Inasmuch as (a) mere marking of a document <strong><em>on admission </em></strong>will not amount to proof, or evidence of the contents of the document or its truth; (b) the <strong><em>probative value</em></strong> of a document ‘marked without objection’ may be <em>low or nil,</em> for want of proper proof; and (c) there is a formal defect to the document for it is a secondary evidence because it is produced without adducing ‘foundational evidence’, it is legitimate to say that before taking an adverse stance as to proof in this count, the court should give an opportunity to the party who relies on the document to cure the deficiency.</p>
<p>Defect for not producing a proper power of attorney being curable, in Haryana State Coop.  Supply and Marketing Federation Ltd. v. Jayam Textiles, 2014 AIR SC 1926 (a case under Section 138 Negotiable instruments Act), the Apex Court gave opportunity to the petitioner to produce the authorization of Board of Directors. It is observed that the in Raj Narian v. Indira Nehru Gandhi, (1972) 3 SCC 850 it was held that the rules of pleadings are intended as aids for a fair trial and for reaching a just decision. It is further pointed out that this principle is reiterated in following cases also:</p>

<p><strong><span style="text-decoration:underline">Courts to admit </span><u>documents Without Proof</u></strong></p>
<p>Section 163 of the Evidence Act, reads as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>163. <span style="text-decoration:underline">Giving, as evidence, of document called for and produced on notice</span>: When a party calls for a document which he has given the other party notice to produce, and such document is produced and inspected by the party calling for its production, he is bound to give it as evidence if the party producing it requires him to do so.</li>
</ul>
<p>It is observed in Government of Bengal v. Santiram Mondal, AIR 1930 Cal 370, with respect to a document used under Sec. 163, as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“The further contention is that if they are to be admitted, they cannot be put in or at any rate used without proof. But the section itself says that the party calling for it is bound to give it as evidence if required to do so, and that certainly <span style="text-decoration:underline">means that it goes in as a record of the particular proceeding</span> and that<span style="text-decoration:underline"> it can be looked at to see what it includes or omits</span>.”</li>
</ul>
<p>It is noteworthy that Order XI rule 15 and Order XII rule 8 are the provisions in the CPC to give notice to the other party to produce documents (for ‘inspection’ and ‘show court’, respectively). In Government of Bengal v. Santiram Mondal, AIR 1930 Cal 370, and R v. Makhan, AIR 1940 Cal 167 it was observed that Section 163 of the Evidence Act applies to Criminal Proceedings also.</p>
<p><strong><u>Impounding of Documents – When Produced or When Exhibited</u></strong></p>
<p>In <strong>Yogesh Kumar Sikka v. Monika (2019</strong>) the P &amp; H High Court held as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“12. Court cannot say that it would impound the document only when the document is tendered in evidence for marking. There may be instances where duty and penalty payable may be very high and the party may not choose to rely upon such insufficiently stamped document in order to avoid stamp duty and penalty. In such circumstances, it would result in loss of revenue to the exchequer. The power of impounding a document is to collect stamp duty and penalty whenever there is an escape of duty. Therefore, when it is brought to the notice of the Court that a document is insufficiently stamped, the Court exercising its power under S. 33 of the Act has to pass an order at the first instance for impounding the document. Though there is a discretion vested in the Court to exercise powers under S. 33 and 34 of the Act, <span style="text-decoration: underline">no Court can</span> hold that it would <span style="text-decoration: underline">wait till the document is tendered</span> in evidence. In such circumstances, there may be chances of loss of revenue to the exchequer.”</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><u>UNREGISTERED DOCUMENTS </u></strong><strong><u>– Effect of Marking Without Objection</u></strong></p>
<p>Under <span style="text-decoration:underline">section 49</span> of the Registration Act, if a document required to be registered is not registered, it is <span style="text-decoration:underline">not admissible in evidence</span> ; and such unregistered document can only be used as an evidence of <span style="text-decoration:underline">collateral purpose</span>.</p>
<p>With respect to Unregistered (Necessarily Registrable) Documents it is held by the Apex Court in <strong>K.B. Saha and Sons Private Limited v. Development Consultant Ltd,</strong> (2008) 8 SCC 564: AIR 2008 SC (Supp) 850, as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“34. From the principles laid down in the various decisions of this Court and the High Courts, as referred to here-in-above, it is evident that :</li>
<li>A document required to be registered is <span style="text-decoration:underline">not admissible</span> into evidence <span style="text-decoration:underline">under section 49</span> of the Registration Act.</li>
<li>Such unregistered document can however be used as an evidence of <span style="text-decoration:underline">collateral purpose</span> as provided in the Proviso to section 49 of the Registration Act. ….”</li>
</ul>
<p>In the light of the Supreme Court decision in <strong>K.B. Saha and Sons Private Limited</strong> , it appears that the observation of the Karnataka High Court in Nanda Behera v. Akhsaya Kumar Behera, 2017AIR (CC) 1893, that once the Court, rightly or wrongly, decides to admit the documents in evidence, so far as the parties are concerned, the matter is closed, is not applicable to unregistered (compulsorily registrable) documents.</p>
<p>However, the Calcutta High Court in Dipak Kumar Singh v. Park Street Properties (P) Limited, AIR 2014 Cal 167, distinguished K.B. Saha &amp; Sons Private Limited, (2008) 8 SCC 564, and other decisions saying that ‘the question of admissibility of a document, which had been admitted in evidence, was not taken up for consideration’ in those decisions. The High Court relied on Javer Chand v. Pukhraj Surana, AIR 1961 SC 1655 (question as to admissibility on the ground that it has not been stamped), which held that once a document had been marked as an exhibit in a case and the trial had proceeded all along on the footing that the document was an exhibit in the case and had been used by the parties in examination and cross-examination of their witnesses, it was not open either to the trial court itself or to a court of appeal or revision to go behind that order.</p>

<li class="has-small-font-size">(b) where any person from whom a stamped receipt could have been demanded, has given an unstamped receipt and such receipt, if stamped, would be admissible in evidence against him, then such receipt shall be admitted in evidence against him, then such receipt shall be admitted in evidence against him on payment of a penalty of one rupee by the person tendering it;</li>

<li class="has-small-font-size">(e) nothing herein contained shall prevent the admission of any instrument in any Court when such instrument has been executed by or on behalf of<sup> </sup> the<sup> </sup>Government or where it bears the certificate of the Collector as provided by section 32 or any other provision of this Act.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">Unstamped document cannot be looked at even for any collateral purpose</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration:underline">Privy Council</span> in Ram Rattan v. Parma Nath,<strong> </strong>AIR 1946 PC 51, held that section 35 of the Stamp Act <span style="text-decoration:underline">prohibited the unstamped (or inadequately stamped) document from being looked at even for any collateral purpose</span>, as it enacts that no instrument chargeable with duty shall be admitted in evidence ‘for any purpose’. The unstamped (or inadequately stamped) document <span style="text-decoration:underline">becomes admissible on payment of penalty</span> under Stamp Act or on payment of the stamp duty after impounding.</p>
<p>In <strong>Omprakash v. Laxminarayan</strong>, (2014) 1 SCC 618, the Apex Court observed as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li class="has-small-font-size">“From a <span style="text-decoration:underline">plain reading of the aforesaid provision (S. 35 of the Stamp Act),</span> it is evident that an authority to receive evidence <span style="text-decoration:underline">shall not admit any instrument unless it is duly stamped. </span>An instrument not duly stamped shall be admitted in evidence on payment of the duty with which the same is chargeable or in the case of an instrument insufficiently stamped, of the amount required to make up such duty together with penalty. As we have observed earlier, the deed of agreement having been insufficiently stamped, the same was inadmissible in evidence. The court being an authority to receive a document in evidence to give effect thereto, the agreement to sell with possession is an instrument which requires payment of the stamp duty applicable to a deed of conveyance. Duty as required, has not been paid and, hence, the <span style="text-decoration:underline">trial court rightly held the same to be inadmissible in evidence</span>.” </li>
</ul>
<p>The Apex Court upheld the observation of the MP High Court in Writ Petition No. 6464 of 2008, overruling the impugned judgment (Laxminarayan v. Omprakash 2008 (2) MPLJ 416). The MP High Court had observed as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li class="has-small-font-size">“To put the record straight, the correctness of the impugned judgment (Laxminarayan &amp; Ors. v. Omprakash &amp; Ors., 2008 (2) MPLJ 416) came up for consideration before a Division Bench of the High Court itself in <span style="text-decoration:underline">Writ Petition No. 6464 of 2008</span> (Man Singh (deceased) through Legal Representatives Smt. Sumranbai &amp; Ors. v. Rameshwar) and same has been overruled by judgment dated January 22, 2010. The High Court observed as follows:
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“8. A document would be admissible on basis of the recitals made in the document and not on basis of the pleadings raised by the parties. In the matter of Laxminarayan (supra), the learned Single Judge with due respect to his authority we don’t think that he did look into the legal position but it appears that he was simply swayed away by the argument that as the defendant was denying the delivery of possession, the endorsement/recital in the document lost all its effect and efficacy.</li>
<li>9. It would be trite to say that if in a document certain recitals are made then the Court would decide the admissibility of the document on the strength of such recitals and not otherwise. In a given case, if there is an<span style="text-decoration:underline"> absolute unregistered sale deed</span> and the parties say that the same is not required to be registered then <span style="text-decoration:underline">we don’t think that the Court would be entitled to admit</span> the document because s<span style="text-decoration:underline">imply the parties say so</span>. The jurisdiction of the Court flows from Sections 33, 35 and 38 of the Indian Stamp Act and the <span style="text-decoration:underline">Court has to decide the question of admissibility</span>. With all humility at our command we over-rule the judgment in the matter of Laxminarayan (supra).” </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="has-small-font-size">We respectfully agree with the conclusion of the High Court (<span style="text-decoration:underline">Writ Petition No. 6464 of 2008</span>)  in this regard.</li>
<li class="has-small-font-size">In view of what we have observed above, the order of the High Court (Laxminarayan v. Omprakash 2008 (2) MPLJ 416) is unsustainable and cannot be allowed to stand.”</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">Unstamped or Insufficiently Stamped Pro-note</span></strong></p>
<p>Unstamped or insufficiently stamped promissory note cannot be marked in evidence. The weight of authority is on the side that says it is incurable. Hence no secondary evidence can also be lead on the same. It cannot be used for collateral purpose also. But the creditor can prosecute a suit upon ‘original consideration’.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Section 36 of the Stamp Act</strong> – <strong>Once admitted shall NOT</strong> <strong>be called in question</strong></span></p>
<p>Section 36 of the Stamp Act provides as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“36. <strong>Admission of instrument where not to be questioned</strong> – Where an instrument has been admitted in evidence such admission shall not except as provided in Section 61, <strong>be called in question</strong> at any stage of the same suit or proceeding on the ground that the instrument has not been duly stamped “.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">Objection as to</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline">sufficiency of stamp, be raised when document is tendered </span></strong></p>
<p>The Apex Court held in <strong>Javer Chand v. Pukhraj Surana</strong>, AIR 1961 SC 1655, as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li class="has-small-font-size">“Where a question as to the admissibility of a document is raised on the ground that it has not been stamped, or has not been properly stamped, it has to be decided then and there when the document is tendered in evidence.  <span style="text-decoration:underline">The Court has to judicially determine the matter as soon as the document is tendered</span> in evidence and <span style="text-decoration:underline">before it is marked </span>as an exhibit in the case. … Once a document has been marked as an exhibit in the case and the trial has proceeded all along on the footing that the document was an exhibit in the case and has been used by the parties in examination and cross-examination of their witnesses, S. 36 of the Stamp Act comes into operation. <span style="text-decoration:underline">Once a document has been admitted</span> in evidence, as aforesaid, it is <span style="text-decoration:underline">not open </span>either to the Trial Court itself or to a Court of Appeal or revision <span style="text-decoration:underline">to go behind that order.</span> Such an order is not one of those judicial orders which are liable to be reviewed or revised by the same Court or a Court of superior jurisdiction.”</li>
</ul>
<p>A document purporting to be an unregistered sale deed was marked as an Exhibit. The High Court directed that the aforesaid document should be de-marked and not be treated as an exhibit.</p>
<p>In Lothamasu Sambasiva Rao v. Thadwarthi Balakotiah, AIR 1973 AP 342, and several other decisions it had been held that Section 35 was only a bar to the admissibility of an unstamped or insufficiently stamped document; and that when it was admitted in evidence it cannot afterwards be withdrawn.

<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">Latest view of the Supreme Court</span></strong></p>
<p>It appears that the latest view of the Supreme Court is that given in Sirikonda Madhava Rao v. N. Hemalatha (SC), 12 April, 2022. Referring Javer Chand v. Pukhraj Surana, 1962-2 SCR 333; Shyamal Kumar Roy v. Sushil Kumar Agarwal, 2006-11 SCC 331, it is held as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li class="has-small-font-size">“Once a document has been admitted in evidence, such admission cannot be called in question at any stage of the suit or proceedings on the ground that the instrument has not been duly stamped. Objection as to admissibility of a document on the ground of sufficiency of stamp, has to raised when the document is tendered in evidence. Thereafter, it is not open to the parties, or even the court, to reexamine the order or issue.”</li>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Paradoxical and Incongruent Propositions</strong> – <strong>Remain yet to be solved</strong></span></p>
<p>The following two forceful propositions stand paradoxical and incongruent.</p>
<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li>There is a duty upon every Judge not  to  admit a document that is <strong>not duly stamped</strong> even if no objection to mark it.</li>
<li>The court should not exclude an insufficiently stamped (or <strong>unstamped</strong>) deed once <strong>marked without objection</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<p>The Karnataka High Court held in Smt. Savithramma R.C v. M/s. Vijaya Bank, AIR 2015 Kar 175, as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li class="has-small-font-size">“6. From the aforesaid statutory provisions and the decisions, it is clear that a duty is cast upon every judge to examine every document, which is produced or comes before him in the performance of his functions. On such examination, if it appears to the Judge that such instrument is not duly stamped, an obligation is cast upon him to impound the same. This duty is to be performed by the Judge irrespective of the fact whether any objection to its marking is raised or not. Hence, there is a need for diligence on the part of the Court having regard to the statutory obligation under Section 33 of the Karnataka Stamp Act. Section 34 of the Karnataka Stamp Act<strong>*</strong> mandates that an instrument, which is not duly stamped shall not be admitted in evidence. If any objection is taken to the admissibility of the evidence, it shall be decided then and there. If this document is found to be insufficiently stamped, then in terms of the proviso(a) to Section 34, the Court shall call upon the person, who is tendering the said document to pay duty and ten times penalty and thereafter admit the document in evidence. If duty and penalty is not paid, the document shall not be admitted in evidence.<strong></strong>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>*</strong><strong><sup>Corresponding to Sec. 35, Indian Stamp Act</sup></strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="has-small-font-size"><strong>If such an objection is not taken at the time of admitting the said instrument in evidence, and the insufficiently stamped document is admitted in evidence then Section 35** of the Act provides that such admission shall not be called in question at any stage of the same suit or proceedings on the ground that the instrument has not been duly stamped.</strong>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><sup><strong>**</strong></sup><strong><sup>Corresponding to Sec. 36, Indian Stamp Act</sup></strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="has-small-font-size"><span style="text-decoration:underline">It has nothing to do with impounding</span> the document. <span style="text-decoration: underline">A duty is cast upon every judge to examine every document that is sought to be marked in evidence.</span> The nomenclature of the document is not decisive. The question of admissibility will have to be decided by reading the document and deciding its nature and classification. Even while recording ex parte evidence or while recording evidence in the absence of the Counsel for the other side, the Court should be vigilant and examine and ascertain the nature of the document proposed to be marked and ensure that it is a document which is admissible. The <span style="text-decoration:underline">Court should not depend on objections of the other Counsel before considering whether the document is admissible in evidence or not</span>. Section 33 of the Stamp Act casts a <span style="text-decoration:underline">duty on the Court to examine</span> the document to find out whether it is <span style="text-decoration:underline">duly stamped or not</span>, irrespective of the fact whether an objection to its marking is raised or not.”</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><u>Should the court sit silent and question after marking unstamped document unopposed</u></strong></p>
<p>Though Smt. Savithramma R.C v. M/s. Vijaya Bank, AIR 2015 Kar 175, clarified the position with great clarity, still, it is not definite whether the court should sit silent and mark the document if it is not opposed; and to raise its eye-brows after marking it unopposed. It is yet to be solved after considering all relevant aspects.</p>
<p>Referring Sec. 36 of the (Indian) Stamp Act, Karnataka High Court pointed out in Nanda Behera v. Akhsaya Kumar Behera, 2017AIR (CC) 1893, that <span style="text-decoration:underline">once the Court, rightly or wrongly, decides to admit the documents</span> in evidence, so far as the parties are concerned, <span style="text-decoration:underline">the matter is closed</span>. As stated earlier, this principle is followed in the following cases, with respect to insufficiently stamped document:</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration:underline">Conclusion</span></strong> </p>
<p>It is not at all fair to say that if the court inadvertently marked a document or it failed to object marking, the document will stand good in favour of the party who tendered the document. </p>
