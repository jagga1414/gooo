<p><strong>Saji Koduvath, Advocate, Kottayam.</strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration:underline">A</span></strong><span style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline"> puzzling question</span>: Is ‘discovery’, under Rule 12 of Order XI, CPC, an inevitable ‘pre-step’ to order ‘production’ under Rule  14 of Order XI?</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration:underline">Answer</span>:          <strong><span style="text-decoration:underline">Yes.</span></strong> </p>
<p>The probe is surfaced for it is not specifically stated either in Rule 12 or in Rule 14 that the ‘discovery’ under Rule 12 is a ‘condition precedent’ for ordering ‘production’ under Rule  14; though obviously there is a nexus between ‘discovery’ and ‘production’. The sequence in which these provisions are arrayed also gives us cue to answer this problem. </p>

<p><u><b>Resolutions and Propositions</b></u></p>
<p>Analysis of Rule 12 and 14 impeccably establishes complementarity between these provisions, and unerringly settles that ‘Discovery’ of documents under Rule 12 of Order XI is an <span style="text-decoration: underline">inevitable <em>condition precedent</em> </span>for ‘Production’ of documents under Rule 14, as shown under:</p>
<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Rule 12</strong> (for discovery) expressly allows a party to the suit to <span style="text-decoration: underline">apply the Court </span>for an order directing any other party to make ‘discovery on oath’.</li>
<li>The party against whom discovery (on oath) is applied for is required, to file <span style="text-decoration: underline">affidavit </span>(under Rule 13). Rule 13 further requires him to place his ‘<span style="text-decoration: underline">objections</span> to produce’.</li>
<li>Rule 12 directs that the documents sought for <span style="text-decoration: underline">must relate to matters in question; </span>that on the hearing of such application the <span style="text-decoration: underline">Court may either refuse or adjourn</span> the same; and that if the court is satisfied that such <span style="text-decoration: underline">discovery is not necessary, make such order</span>, as the court thinks fit.
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><mark class="has-inline-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#0921d1">Though ‘production’ under <strong>Rule 14</strong> is the <strong>serious matter</strong> when compared to ‘discovery’ under Rule 12, there is no provision  in Rule 14 (as in Rule 12) for –</mark>

</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Failure to produce affidavit under Rule 12 invites stringent actions under Rule 21 (suit dismissed, defence struck out, etc.). 
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>(i) <mark class="has-inline-color" style="color:#1006c8">Effect of non-production of documents under Rule 14 is not specified in R. 21</mark>; </li>

</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>We see significant and severe actions as regards ‘discovery of documents’ under Rule 12 (that is, filing affidavit and objection, hearing, dismissal of suit, striking  out defence, etc.). And, no such significant actions are attached to Rule 14. Why?</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>The only answer is that the legislature took Rule 12 and 14 as concomitant provisions. That is, ‘production’ of a document under Rule 14 comes into consideration only if it is ‘discovered’ under Rule 14.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">Legislative Intention – Concordance Between ‘Discovery’ and ‘Production’</span></strong></p>
<p>The indisputable reciprocity between ‘discovery’ and ‘production’, and the sequence in which the they are arrayed in Rule 12 and 14, ensure that compliance of Rule 12 is a necessary pre-condition for ordering ‘production’ under Rule 14. Therefore, it is definite that discovery under Rule 12 partakes its ‘production’ (as the next step, under Rule 14). </p>
<p><span style="text-decoration:underline">The afore-stated propositions are fortified by the following:</span></p>
<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li>Ordering production, under Rule 14, is purely a discretionary matter with court. 
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Rule 14 reads – “<span style="text-decoration:underline"><mark class="has-inline-color has-primary-color">It shall be lawful for the Court</mark></span> … t<span style="text-decoration:underline">o order the production</span> … of such of the documents in his possession or power … ”.  </li>
<li>Import of these words are obvious in itself. That is, wide-open discretion is given to the court for ordering production under rule 14. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>It is unquestionable that a party to the suit has no vested right to seek ‘production’ of any document under rule 14-
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong><mark class="has-inline-color" style="color:#0f0eed">even after ‘discovery’ of the same under rule 12</mark></strong>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Similarly, the party to the suit has no vested right to seek production of ‘<span style="text-decoration: underline">all documents</span>‘ discovered under Rule 12<strong>.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">Do the words “<u><mark class="has-inline-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#1e0dcd">at any time</mark></u>” in Rule 14 <strong>indicate</strong> – it is independent from Rule 12</span></strong>?</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>No. </strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Rule 14 reads as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“It shall be <span style="text-decoration:underline">lawful for the Court</span>, <u><mark class="has-inline-color" style="color:#1e0dcd">at any time</mark></u> during the pendency of any suit, <span style="text-decoration:underline">to order the production</span> by any party thereto ….. “</li>
</ul>
<p>It is definite – the words “<strong><u><u><mark class="has-inline-color" style="color:#1e0dcd">at any time</mark></u></u></strong> during the pendency of any suit,” only emphasise-  </p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>that a party to the suit has no vested right to seek ‘production’ under rule 14, <strong>soon after</strong> a document is discovered under rule 12; and</li>
<li>that wide-open discretion is given to the court for ordering production under rule 14, <u><mark class="has-inline-color" style="color:#1e0dcd">at any time</mark></u><mark class="has-inline-color has-foreground-color">.</mark></li>
</ul>
<p><strong><u>Documents <mark class="has-inline-color has-primary-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Referred to</mark> in “Pleadings or Affidavit”; Can Production be Ordered?</u></strong></p>
<p>Now, a question may reasonably and logically arise – Assume, certain relevant documents are <mark class="has-inline-color has-primary-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">referred to</mark> in <strong>“pleadings or affidavit”</strong>; can’t the court order production of those documents (directly) under Rule 14, on application of the other party?</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Strictly speaking, <strong>No</strong> – because of the specific provisions of the CPC as to inspection (and to take copies) of documents referred to in pleadings or affidavits in <strong>Order XI</strong> rule 15.<mark class="has-inline-color has-primary-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><strong>*</strong></mark>

M/S Binani Cement Ltd., (2014) 3 SCR 1).</sup></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>It goes without saying that the permission for taking copies is provided for ‘exhibiting’ the same by the party concerned, as part of his evidence. </li>
<li>Rule 15 Order XI CPC reads as under:
<ul class="wp-block-list">

<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Yes;</strong> it can be under inherent power. But, it must be remembered that because of the specific provisions of the CPC as to inspection (and to take copies) of documents <strong><mark class="has-inline-color has-primary-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">referred to</mark></strong> in pleadings or affidavits in <strong>Order XI</strong> rule 15, it may not be proper for a party to invoke Sec. 151 – though the power is open to the Court. The Court can also invoke Sec. 165 of the Evidence Act.</li>
<li>Note: 
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Order XI rule 12 speaks as to <strong>discovery</strong> of documents – (and not documents in ‘<strong>possession of</strong>‘ a party).</li>
<li>Order XI rule 15 speaks as to documents – ‘<strong>referred to</strong>‘ (and not documents in ‘<strong>possession of</strong>‘ a party).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline"><mark class="has-inline-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#1417ec">A party in “possession of a document” can be directed to produce the same</mark></span></strong></p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>A <strong>party in</strong> “<strong><mark class="has-inline-color has-primary-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">possession</mark> of a document</strong>” (Distinct from “Documents <mark class="has-inline-color has-primary-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><strong>Referred to</strong></mark> in <strong>Pleadings or Affidavits</strong>” – Order XI rule 15)  can be directed to produce the document. The plaintiff could file an <u>application calling for the said document</u> from the defendant.</li>
</ul>
<p>In Anil Rishi v. Gurbaksh Singh, (<strong>S.B. Sinha</strong>, P.K. Balasubramanyan) it is held (obiter) as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“A <strong>party in</strong> <strong><mark class="has-inline-color has-primary-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">possession</mark> of a document</strong> can always be directed to produce the same. The plaintiff <strong>could file an <u>application calling for the said document</u></strong> from the defendant and the defendant could have been directed by the learned Trial Judge to produce the same.”</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">Does Sec. 30 CPC, Give an Independent Right to Order Production of Documents</span></strong></p>
<p>Does Sec. 30 CPC (the substantive provision) give an independent right, is another question that may arise in this matter. The beginning portion of the section itself makes it clear that the section is “subject to such conditions and limitations as may be prescribed”.  Therefore, it is clear that the power of the court to order production of document, under Sec. 30, is subject to the provisions in O. XI r. 12 and 14.</p>
<p>Sec. 30 CPC reads as under:</p>
<p>“Sec. 30 – <span style="text-decoration: underline">Power to Order Discovery and the like</span>.</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline">Subject to such conditions and limitations as may be prescribed</span>, the Court may, at any time, either of its own motion or on the application of any party-</li>
<li>(a) make such Orders as may be necessary or reasonable in all matters relating to the delivery and answering of interrogatories, the admission of documents and facts, and the discovery, inspection, <span style="text-decoration: underline">production</span>, impounding and return of documents or other material objects producible as evidence;</li>
<li>(b) issue summonses to persons whose attendance is required either to give evidence or to produce documents or such other objects as aforesaid;</li>
<li>(c) Order any fact to be proved by affidavit.”</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">Order XVI Rule 21, CPC (Madras &amp; Kerala Amendment)</span></strong></p>
<p>Yet another provision to be looked into in this matter is Order XVI Rule 21 CPC (Madras &amp; Kerala Amendment). It reads as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“Rule 21 – <span style="text-decoration: underline">Rules in case of parties appearing as Witnesses</span>: (1) When a party to a suit is required by any other party thereto to give evidence or <span style="text-decoration: underline">to produce a document</span>, the provisions as to witnesses shall apply to him so far as applicable.</li>
<li>(2) When a party to a suit gives evidence on his own behalf the Court may, in its discretion, permit him to include as costs in the suit a sum of money equal to the amount payable for travelling and other expenses to other witnesses in the case of similar standing….”</li>
</ul>
<p>It is plain – Order XVI deals with ‘Summoning and Attendance of Witnesses’; and that the Madras and Kerala amendment on Order XVI Rule 21 CPC does not deal with the power of the court to Oder ‘Production of Documents’.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">Can a Party Seek Discovery and Production in One Petition</span>? </strong></p>
<p>Technically it may not be illegal, altogether. But, it will be improper if the court passes orders on both prayers simultaneously, especially since the court has to order production.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">The ‘Scheme’ of CPC</span></strong></p>
<p>The ‘scheme’ of the CPC is also germane. </p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>We can compare the provisions in the CPC as to production of documents with calling for the opposite party as a witness. 
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>There is no  specific provision in the CPC that allows a party to the suit to summon the opposite  party as a witness – though court has  discretion (Order 16 rule 14 CPC), to ‘examine any person, including a party to the suit’ after 1976 Amendment of the CPC. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>(See: Kishori Lal v. Chunni Lal, ILR 31 All. 116, Narayana Pillai v. Kalyani Ammal, 1963 KLT 537,  Muhammed Kunji v. Shahabudeen, 1969 KLT 170.) </li>

</ul>
<p>It is clear, the scheme of the CPC is-</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>(i) not to initiate coercive steps, against a party who does not examine himself as a witness, or withholds a document; </li>
<li>(ii) but to take adverse presumption under Sec. 114 Evidence Act. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration:underline">Notice and Summons to Produce Documents in other Provisions of the CPC</span></strong></p>
<p>Besides the powers of the court under Sec. 165 of Evidence Act, no doubt, the provisions of Order XVI rule 14 (summons to witness to produce documents) and Order XI rule 15 and Order XII rule 8  (notice to the other party to produce documents) provide for production of documents independent of O. XI r. 12 and O. XI r. 14. These enabling provisions do not bestow a vehicle to the court to ignore the provisions under O. XI r. 12 and O. XI r. 14; for, the judicial principle – the <span style="text-decoration: underline">g</span>eneral provisions should yield to specific provisions. </p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Order XVI r. 14</strong></span></p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>“</strong><span style="text-decoration:underline"><strong>Court may of its own accord summon as witnesses strangers to suit</strong>: Subject to the provisions of this Code</span> as to attendance and appearance <span style="text-decoration:underline">and to any law</span> for the time being in force, where the Court at any time thinks it necessary [to examine any person, including a party to the suit], and not called as a witness by a party to the suit, <span style="text-decoration:underline">the Court may</span>, of its own motion, <span style="text-decoration:underline">cause</span> such person to be summoned as a witness to give evidence, or <span style="text-decoration:underline">to produce any document in his possession</span> on a day to be appointed, and may examine him as a witness or require him to produce such document.”

<li>But, the words “<mark class="has-inline-color has-primary-color">of its own accord</mark>“, “<mark class="has-inline-color has-primary-color">subject to the provisions of this Code … and to any law</mark>” and “<mark class="has-inline-color has-primary-color">the Court may</mark>” make it clear that this provision is <strong><span style="text-decoration:underline">not </span></strong>intended to use openhandedly.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration:underline">Order XI rule 15 and Order XII rule 8 </span>are the provisions in the CPC to give notice to the other party to produce documents (for ‘inspection’ and ‘show court’, respectively).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><u>Discovery is Made to Aid the Production of Documents</u></strong></p>
<p>The proposition, ‘production of a document under Rule 14 comes into consideration only if it is ‘discovered’ under Rule 12′ can be fully supported by the decision of the Bombay High Court, in Manager, Ramkrishna Ramnath Bidi v. First Civil J. First Class, Nagpur, AIR 1959 Bom 181 (<strong>J Mudholkar and S Kotwal, JJ</strong>). </p>
<p>Referring O. 11 of the CPC, it is held in this decision as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“In its first eleven rules, Order 11 deals with the delivery of interrogatories …. Then it makes provision for the discovery of documents in rules 12 and 13. <span style="text-decoration: underline">After discovery is provided for,</span> it deals with the subject of <span style="text-decoration: underline">production of documents</span> in Rule 14. Then provision is made for the inspection of the documents produced in Rules 15, 17 and 18 of the Order.</li>
<li>Reading the Order as a whole, it seems to us clear that the provisions made in the <span style="text-decoration: underline">Order for discovery</span> and inspection are only provisions <span style="text-decoration: underline">made in order to aid the production of documents</span> before the Court, particularly the provisions regarding ‘discovery’.”</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><u>Views of the Apex Court</u></strong></p>
<p>The decision, <strong>M. L. Sethi v. R. P. Kapur</strong>, AIR 1972 SC 2379, emphasises that it is not necessary for an applicant under Order XI rule 12 to specify in detail the documents sought to be discovered when they are in the hands of the other side; and that the claim of privilege can be considered only after discovery, when the stage of production is reached. It is also made clear that if the document is relevant for the purpose of throwing light on the matter in dispute, though it might not be admissible in evidence, it can be put to discovery under rule 12.</p>
<p>It is true, our Apex Court, did not give effect to the proposition that compliance (discovery) of Rule 12 is a condition precedent to order production under Rule 14 in <strong>Basanagouda v. SB Amarkhed, </strong>AIR 1992 SC 1163, when it proceeded as under: </p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“The Court, therefore, is <span style="text-decoration: underline">clearly empowered and it shall be lawful for it to Order the production</span>, by any party to the suit, such documents in his possession or power relate to any matter in question in the suit provided the Court shall think right that the production of the documents are necessary to decide the matter in question.” 
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Note: Whether ‘discovery under Rule 12 is a condition precedent for ordering production of documents under Rule 14’ was not considered in this case.</li>
