<p><strong><u>Introduction</u></strong></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec. 33 of the Registration Ac</span>t <span style="text-decoration: underline">will NOT be attracted if the the power of attorney himself executes the document;</span> and Sec. 33 will be attracted only when the document is “executed” by one (including a power of attorney) and “presented” through another holding “power of attorney”. </p>
<p><strong><u>Power of Attorney Concepts in Law</u></strong></p>
<p>In State of Rajasthan v. Basant Nehata, 2005-12 SCC 77, our Apex Court made clear the Concepts on a Power of Attorney. They are the following –</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>It is governed by Chapter X of the Contract Act. It is also governed by the the Powers-of-Attorney Act. </li>
<li>A power of attorney is, as is well known, a document of convenience. </li>
<li>By a power of attorney, an agent is formally appointed to act for the principal.</li>
<li>It is an authority upon another person; but, subject to the limitations contained in the said deed. </li>
<li>The agent derives a right to use the principal’s name. The donee (agent) only acts in place of the donor . </li>
<li>All acts, deeds and things done by done by the agent shall be read as if done by the donor. </li>
<li>Except in cases where power of attorney is <strong>coupled with interest</strong>, it is revocable. </li>
<li>The agent cannot use the power of attorney for his own benefit. </li>
<li>He acts in a fiduciary capacity. </li>
<li>Any act of infidelity or breach of trust is a matter between the donor and the donee.</li>
</ul>
<p>State of Rajasthan v. Basant Nehata, 2005-12 SCC 77, laid down as under”</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“A grant of power of attorney is essentially governed by Chapter X of the Contract Act. By reason of a deed of power of attorney, an agent is formally appointed to act for the principal in one transaction or a series of transactions or to manage the affairs of the principal generally conferring necessary authority upon another person. A deed of power of attorney is executed by the principal in favour of the agent. The agent derives a right to use his name and all acts, deeds and things done by him and subject to the limitations contained in the said deed, the same shall be read as if done by the donor. A power of attorney is, as is well known, a document of convenience. Execution of a power of attorney in terms of the provisions of the Contract Act as also the Powers-of-Attorney Act is valid. A power of attorney, we have noticed hereinbefore, is executed by the donor so as to enable the donee to act on his behalf. Except in cases where power of attorney is coupled with interest, it is revocable. The donee in exercise of his power under such power of attorney only acts in place of the donor subject of course to the powers granted to him by reason thereof. He cannot use the power of attorney for his own benefit. He acts in a fiduciary capacity. Any act of infidelity or breach of trust is a matter between the donor and the donee.”</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">Document can be “Presented” by Purchaser or Donee also</span></strong></span></strong></p>
<p>It is noteworthy that the document can be presented by the purchaser/vendee or donee also, as Sec. 32 directs that the document can be presented by “some person<span style="text-decoration: underline"> executing or claiming under the same</span>“.</p>
<p>Section 33 of the Registration Act lays down that the Power-of-Attorney recognisable for purposes of Section 32 is ‘a power-of-attorney executed before and authenticated by the Registrar or Sub-Registrar within whose district or sub-district the principal resides’ (if the principal at the time of executing the power-of-attorney resides in any part of India).</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Nevertheless, the expression ‘<span style="text-decoration:underline">person executing’ in Section 32 is the person who actually signs or marks the document</span>. </li>
<li>If the document itself is signed by the agent (a power of attorney holder), he is entitled to present the deed for registration (without a Power of Attorney executed before and authenticated by the Registrar or Sub-Registrar).</li>
<li>In other words, ‘a power-of-attorney executed before and authenticated by the Registrar or Sub-Registrar’ is required in the following circumstance-
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>that is, the owner of the property (or his power of attorney) himself signs the deed and a power of attorney is given to another, for registering the deed.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">Presumption on PoA authenticated by a Notary, or any Court, etc.</span></strong></p>
<p>Section 85 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 gives ‘presumption’ on a power of attorney as given under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>85. Presumption as to powers-of-attorney.—The Court shall presume that every document purporting to be a power-of-attorney, and to have been executed before, and authenticated by, a Notary Public, or any Court, Judge, Magistrate,  Indian Consul or Vice-Consul, or representative of the Central Government, was so executed and authenticated.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration:underline">Rajni Tandon v. Dulal Ranjan Ghosh Dastidar</span></strong></p>
<p>The Supreme Court elucidated the matter in Rajni Tandon v. Dulal Ranjan Ghosh Dastidar, (2009) 14 SCC 782 as under:</p>
<ul class="has-small-font-size wp-block-list">
<li> “<strong>26</strong>. It is important to bear in mind that one of the categories of persons who are eligible to present documents before the registration office in terms of Section 32 of the Act is the “person executing” the document. The expression “person executing” used in Section 32 of the Act, can only refer to the person who actually signs or marks the document in token of execution, whether for himself or on behalf of some other person. Thus, “person executing” as used in Section 32 (a) of the Act signifies the person actually executing the document and includes a principal who executes by means of an agent. Where a person hold a power of attorney which authorises him to execute a document as agent for someone else, and he executes a document under the terms of the power of attorney, he is, so far as the registration office is concerned, the actual executant of the document and is entitled under Section 32 (a) to present it for registration and get it registered.</li>
<li><strong>33</strong>. Where a deed is executed by an agent for a principal and the same agent signs, appears and presents the deed or admits execution before the Registering Officer, that is not a case of presentation under Section 32 (c) of the Act. As mentioned earlier the provisions of Section 33 will come into play only in cases where presentation is in terms of Section 32 (c) of the Act. In other words, <span style="text-decoration:underline">only in cases where the person(s) signing the document cannot present the document before the registering officer and gives a power of attorney to another to present the document that the provisions of Section 33 get attracted.</span> It is only in such a case, that the said power of attorney has to be necessarily executed and authenticated in the manner provided under Section 33 (1) (a) of the Act.”</li>
</ul>
<p>The Apex Court upheld the view in the following decisions, placed by the appellants:</p>
<ul class="has-small-font-size wp-block-list">
<li>Motilal v. Ganga Bai [AIR 1915 Nag 18],</li>

<p> <span style="font-size: revert;background-color: var(--global--color-background);color: var(--global--color-foreground);font-family: var(--global--font-secondary)">Sec. 33 of the Registration Act states that the ‘power-of-attorney executed before and authenticated by the Registrar or Sub-Registrar’ is necessary for presenting the document for registration ‘if the principal at the time of executing the power-of-attorney resides in any part of India’. </span></p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li> “24. The words “executed and authenticated in manner hereinafter mentioned” in Section 32(c) would mean the procedure specified in Section 33. This is clear from the opening words of Section 33 which reads “for the purposes of Section 32, the following power of attorney shall alone be recognised”. Section 32 refers to documents presented for registration by a holder of “power of attorney” in clause (c) and it therefore follows that the procedure specified under Section 33 would be attracted where a document is presented by a person holding “powers of attorney” of the persons mentioned in clause (a) of Section 32.</li>
<li>25. The aforesaid position makes it explicitly clear that Section 32 of the Act requires the documents sought to be registered, to be presented, inter alia by the person executing it. In other words, the said expression requires presence of the actual person executing the document. The basic principle underlying this provision of the Act is to get before the Sub-Registrar the actual executant who, in fact, executes the document in question. In fact, the ratio of the decision in Ram Gopal [AIR 1960 Punj 226] has laid down a similar proposition on the conjoint reading of Section 32 and Section 33 of the Act and after referring to all the judgments noted hereinbefore. Same view has been expressed earlier by the Bombay High Court in Ratilal Nathubhai v. Rasiklal Maganlal [AIR 1950 Bom 326].</li>
<li>26. It is important to bear in mind that one of the categories of persons who are eligible to present documents before the registration office in terms of Section 32 of the Act is the “person executing” the document. The expression “person executing” used in Section 32 of the Act, can only refer to the person who actually signs or marks the document in token of execution, whether for himself or on behalf of some other person. Thus, “person executing” as used in Section 32(a) of the Act signifies the <span style="text-decoration: underline">person actually executing the document and includes a principal who executes by means of an agent.</span> Where a person holds a power of attorney which authorises him to execute a document as agent for someone else, and he executes a document under the terms of the power of attorney, he is, so far as the registration office is concerned, the actual executant of the document and is entitled under Section 32(a) to present it for registration and get it registered.”</li>

<p id="p_11">The Madras High Court,  in <strong>Manoharan v.

<p>Kerala High Court, relying on Manoharan v. Velu, it was held in <strong>Anitha Rajan v. Revenue Divisional Officer</strong>, <strong>AIR 2010 Ker 153</strong>, that it was not necessary to produce the power of attorney, even if executed outside India, for adjudication if it was sufficiently stamped. The High Court definitely held further that the Village Officer, Nattika Village erred in directing the petitioner to produce the (sufficiently stamped) original power of attorney before the Revenue Divisional Officer for adjudication under sections 31 and 32 of the Kerala Stamp Act, 1959.</p>

<li>23A. <span style="text-decoration:underline">Re-registration of certain documents.</span> Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Act, if in any case a document requiring registration has been accepted for registration by a Registrar or Sub-Registrar from a <span style="text-decoration:underline">person not duly empowered to present the same</span>, and has been registered, any person claiming under such document may, within four months form his first becoming aware that the registration of such document is invalid, present such document or cause the same to be presented, in accordance with the provisions of Part VI for re-registration in the office of the Registrar of the district in which the document was originally registered; and upon the Registrar being satisfied that the document was so accepted for registration from a person not duly empowered to present the same, he shall proceed to the re-registration of the document as if it has not been previously registered, and as if such presentation for re-registration was a presentation for registration made within the time allowed therefore under Part IV, and all the provisions of this Act, as to registration of documents, shall apply to such re-registration; and such document, if duly re-registered in accordance with the provisions of this section, shall be deemed to have been duly registered for all purposes from the date of its original registration</li>
<li>24. <span style="text-decoration:underline">Documents executed by several persons at different times.</span> Where there are several persons executing a document at different times, such document may be presented for registration and re-registration within four months from the date of each execution.</li>
<li>25. <span style="text-decoration:underline">Provision where delay in presentation is unavoidable</span>. (1) If, owing to urgent necessity or unavoidable accident, any document executed, or copy of a decree or order made, in India is not presented for registration till after the expiration of the time hereinbefore prescribed in that behalf, the Registrar, in cases where the delay in presentation does not exceed four months, may direct that, on payment of a <span style="text-decoration:underline">fine not exceeding ten times</span> the amount of the proper <span style="text-decoration:underline">registration-fee</span>, such document shall be accepted for registration.</li>
<li>(2) Any application for such direction may be lodged with a Sub-Registrar, who shall forthwith forward it to the Registrar to whom he is subordinate.</li>
<li>“26. <strong><span style="text-decoration:underline">Documents executed out of India.</span> </strong>When a document purporting to have been executed by all or any of the parties out of India is not presented for registration till after the expiration of the time hereinbefore prescribed in that behalf, the registering officer, if satisfied—<br/>(a) that the instrument was so executed, and<br/>(b) that it has been presented for registration within four months after its arrival in India, <br/>may, on payment of the proper registration-fee accept such document for registration.”</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><u>Registration with Penalty – within Eight Months</u></strong></p>
<p>After four months, document can be presented within another four months to the District Registrar.</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>The District Registrar may impose a penalty up to a maximum of ten times the registration fees and grant permission to Sub-Registrar to register the document (as per Sec. 25 – quoted above). </li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration:underline">Registration After Eight Months</span></strong></p>
<p>After eight months  a document can be registered if impediments like court- injunction (Raj Kumar Dey v. Tarapada Dey, AIR 1987 SC 2195),  bona fide delay in collecting stamps (Nestor Builders And Developers v. State Of Maharashtra,24 June, 2015,  (S.C. Dharmadhikari, J.) etc.</p>
<p>In Unitech Ltd. v. Telangana State Industrial Infrastructure Corpn.,  2021 SCC OnLine SC 99, it is held by our Apex Court as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“TSIIC and the State of Telangana have brought to our notice that the Development Agreement, on the basis of which Unitech has sought to avail its contractual remedy has not been registered or assessed to stamp duty. Under Article 3.1 of the Development Agreement, <span style="text-decoration:underline">the obligation of paying registration fees and stamp duty is on Unitech</span>. It is well-settled law that the <span style="text-decoration:underline">Stamp Act is a fiscal measure enacted to secure the revenue for the State, and not to arm the opponent with a weapon of technicality.</span>  Unitech’s claim to compensatory payment cannot be defeated on the sole ground of the payment of stamp duty. The Development Agreement shall have to be impounded and be presented to the Chief Controlling Revenue Authority in the State of Telangana for assessment of stamp duty and to the competent authority for registration. The assessment shall be completed within thirty days. The appropriate <span style="text-decoration:underline">stamp duty and registration charges liable to be paid in terms of the determination shall be paid by TSIIC and be deducted from the refund due and payable to Unitech under the terms of this order</span>.”</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration:underline">End-words</span> <span style="text-decoration:underline">– There is no no meaning in ‘complaining’, as-per-law</span></strong></p>
<p>From experience we see – when one points out the ‘law’ to the officers of the Registration Department in India, most of them get irritated. The reasons are evident; and the root-cause is known to everybody who approached a registration office for registration of a deed. The top executive machinery wink at their illegal deeds. If the registration proceedings are simplified, the illegalities will be stopped within a day. The stamp-duty for various documents are to be made reasonable also; and one should not be ‘compelled’ to make false statement as to ‘consideration’ in the documents.  It is definite – the power-bodies will not do it. As in other fields, the rap has to begin from the ‘top’. (When the matters are clear to everybody – police, vigilance and even courts – mark, there is no no meaning in ‘complaining’, as-per-law!)</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">Should a Power of Attorney be Compulsorily Registered</span></strong></p>
<p>Those Power of Attorneys that fall under clause (b) of Sec. 17(1) Registration Act alone requires registration. Sec. 17(1)(b) reads as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“(b) other non-testamentary instruments which purport or operate to create, declare, assign, limit or extinguish, whether in present or in future, any right, title or interest, whether vested or contingent, of the value of one hundred rupees and upwards, to or in immovable property”</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Power of Attorney</strong> “</span><strong><u>coupled with interest</u></strong>”</p>
<p>A Power of Attorney that is “<strong><u>coupled with interest</u></strong>” requires registration.</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>E.g., if the power of attorney is issued by the owner after obtaining entire sale consideration from the holder of power of attorney, and if (in fact) it set-forth a “sale of property”, it falls under the category ‘power of attorney coupled with interest’. (See as to ‘General-Power-of-Attorney-sale’: Suraj Lamp and Industries P. Limited v. State of Haryana, (2012) 1 SCC 656).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">Kerala Amendment to Sec. 17(1)(g)</span></strong></p>
<p>Registration Act, Kerala Amendment, Sec. 17(1)(g), requires registration for development,<span style="text-decoration: underline"> transfer </span>etc. relating to immovable property, except for exempted categories. (It is introduced because it is not a general rule that all power of attorneys for ‘transfer‘ must have been registered.) Sec. 17(1)(g) reads as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>(g) Power of attorney creating any power or right of management, administration, development, <span style="text-decoration: underline">transfer</span> or any other transaction relating to immovable property of the value of one hundred rupees and upwards other than those executed in favour of father, mother, wife, husband, son, adopted son, daughter, adopted daughter, brother, sister, son-in-law or daughter-in-law of the executant.</li>
<li>See: Cherryl Ann Joy v. Sub Registrar, Udumbanchola, Idukki District, ILR 2018-3 Ker 540.</li>
</ul>
<p>But, in Lachchhiram v Imrati, 2017-2 RN 117, it is held that for registration of a deed, registered power of attorney is needed (relying on – obiter – Manjunath Anandappa Urf Shivappa Hanasi v. Tammanasa, (2003)10 SCC 390).</p>
