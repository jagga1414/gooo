<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li class="has-small-font-size"> “There is an essential distinction between burden of proof and onus of proof: burden of proof lies upon a person who has to prove the fact and which, never shifts. Onus of proof shifts. Such a shifting of onus is a continuous process in the evaluation of evidence. In our opinion, in a suit for possession based on title once the plaintiff has been able to <strong>create a high degree of <span style="text-decoration: underline">probability</span></strong> so as to <span style="text-decoration: underline">shift the onus on the defendant</span> it is for the defendant to discharge his onus and in the absence thereof the burden of proof lying on the plaintiff shall be held to have been discharged so as to amount to proof of the plaintiffs title”. (quoted in: Narendra Singh Panwar v. The State of Madhya Pradesh, 2021  Cr LJ 934)</li>
</ul>
<p>Our Apex Court in <strong>Mohd.  Abdullah Azam Khan Vs. Nawab Kazim Ali Khan</strong>, 2023 KLT OnLine 1084 (SC), authoritatively lays down the General principles as to Burden of Proof. It reads:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li class="has-small-font-size">12.1. The legal scheme governing various aspects of ‘burden of proof’ in the Indian context, is contained in <strong>Sections 101 to 106</strong> of the Indian Evidence Act.</li>
<li class="has-small-font-size">12.2. As per <span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Section 101</strong></span> of the Indian Evidence Act, when <span style="text-decoration: underline">a person is bound to prove the existence of any fact</span>, it is said that the <span style="text-decoration: underline">burden of proof lies on that person</span>. This section is based on the rule, ei incumbit probatio qui dicit, non qui negat, which means that the burden of proving a fact rests on the party <span style="text-decoration: underline">who substantially asserts the affirmative</span> of the issue and <span style="text-decoration: underline">not upon the party who denies it</span>, because a <span style="text-decoration: underline">negative is usually incapable of proof</span>. The burden of proving a fact always lies upon the person who asserts and <span style="text-decoration: underline">until such burden is discharged</span>, the <span style="text-decoration: underline">other party is not required to be called upon</span> to prove his case. The <span style="text-decoration: underline">court has to examine</span> as to whether the person upon <span style="text-decoration: underline">whom the burden lies</span> has been able to discharge his burden. However, the above rule is subject to the general principle that <span style="text-decoration: underline">things admitted need not be proved</span>. </li>
<li class="has-small-font-size">12.3. The question as to whether burden of proof has been discharged by a party to the lis or not, would depend upon the <span style="text-decoration: underline">facts and circumstances of the case</span>. <span style="text-decoration: underline">If the facts are admitted </span>or, if otherwise, <span style="text-decoration: underline">sufficient materials</span> have been brought on record so as to enable a Court to arrive at a definite conclusion, <span style="text-decoration: underline">it is idle to contend that the party on whom the burden of proof </span>lies would still be liable to produce direct evidence, vide National Insurance Co. Ltd. vs. Rattani (2009) 2 SCC 75: AIR 2009 SC 1499.</li>
<li class="has-small-font-size">12.4. <span style="text-decoration: underline">Burden to prove documents lie on plaintiff alone</span> as onus is always on the person asserting a proposition or fact which is not self­evident. This position is summarised in the observation to the effect that, an assertion that <span style="text-decoration: underline">a man who is alive was born requires no proof; the onus, is not on the person making the assertion</span>, because <span style="text-decoration: underline">it is self­evident that he had been born</span>. But <span style="text-decoration: underline">to assert</span> that he had been born <span style="text-decoration: underline">on a certain date,</span> if the date is material, requires proof; <span style="text-decoration: underline">the onus is on the person making the assertion</span>, vide Robins vs. National Trust &amp; Co. Ltd. 1927 AC 515: 101 IC 903.</li>
<li class="has-small-font-size">12.5. It is also to be noted at this juncture that there is an essential <span style="text-decoration: underline">distinction between burden of proof and onus of proof</span>. B<span style="text-decoration: underline">urden of proof</span> lies upon a person who has to prove the fact and it <span style="text-decoration: underline">never shifts</span>, onus of proof on the other hand, shifts. Such a shifting of onus is a continuous process in the evaluation of evidence. For instance, In a <span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>suit for possession based on title</strong>,</span> once the <span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>plaintiff has been able to create a high degree of probability so as to shift the onus on the defendant</strong></span>, <span style="text-decoration: underline">it is for the defendant to discharge his onus</span> and in the absence thereof, the burden of proof lying on the plaintiff shall be held to have been discharged so as to amount to proof of the plaintiffs title, vide <span style="text-decoration: underline">RVE Venkatachala Gounder vs. Arulmigu Viswesaraswami and VP Temple AIR 2003 SC 4548</span>: (2003) 8 SCC 752. </li>
<li class="has-small-font-size">12.6. In terms of <strong>section 102</strong> of the Evidence Act, the <span style="text-decoration: underline">initial burden to prove its claim is always on the plaintiff</span> and if he discharges that burden and makes out a case which entitles him to a relief, the <span style="text-decoration: underline">onus shifts </span>to the defendant to prove those circumstances, if any, which would disentitle the plaintiff of the same.</li>
<li class="has-small-font-size">12.7. Where, however, <span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>evidence has been led</strong></span> by the contesting parties, <span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>abstract considerations of onus are out of place</strong> and truth or otherwise must always be adjudged on the evidence led</span> by the parties [Kalwa Devadattam vs. Union, AIR 1964 SC 880] </li>
<li class="has-small-font-size">12.8. As per <strong>Section 103</strong>, the burden of proof as to any particular fact lies on that person <span style="text-decoration: underline">who wishes the Court to believe in its existence</span>, unless it is provided by any law that the proof of that fact shall lie on any particular person. This section <span style="text-decoration: underline">amplifies the general rule in section 101 </span>that the burden of proof lies on the person <span style="text-decoration: underline">who asserts the affirmative</span> of the issue. It lays down that if a person wishes the court to believe in the existence of a particular fact, the onus of proving that fact, is on him, unless the burden of proving it is cast by any law on any particular person.</li>
<li class="has-small-font-size">12.9. <strong>Section 105</strong> is an application of the rule in section 103. When <span style="text-decoration: underline">parties to a dispute adduce evidence</span> to substantiate their claim, <span style="text-decoration: underline">onus becomes <mark class="has-inline-color has-primary-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><strong>academic</strong></mark> and divided</span>, entailing each party to prove their respective plea.</li>
<li class="has-small-font-size">12.10. <strong>Section 106</strong> is an <span style="text-decoration: underline">exception to the general rule</span> laid down in Section 101, that the burden of proving a fact rest on the party who substantially asserts the affirmative of the issue. Section 106 is not intended to relieve any person of that duty or burden but states that when a fact to be proved is <span style="text-decoration: underline">peculiarly within the knowledge of a party,</span> it is for him to prove it. It applies to cases where the fact is especially within a party’s knowledge and to none else. The expression ‘especially’ used in Section 106 means facts that are eminently or <span style="text-decoration: underline">exceptionally within one’s knowledge.</span> This means a party having personal knowledge of certain facts has a duty to appear as a witness and if he does not go to the witness box, there is a strong presumption against him. In an Election Petition, the initial burden to prove determination of age of returned candidate lies on the petitioner, however, burden lies on the respondent to prove facts within his <span style="text-decoration: underline">special knowledge</span>. (Sushil Kumar vs. Rakesh Kumar [ (2003) 8 SCC 673) ]. </li>
<li class="has-small-font-size">12.11. The provisions of Section 106 are unambiguous and categorical in laying down that when any fact is <span style="text-decoration: underline">especially within the knowledge</span> of a person, the burden of proving that fact is upon him. If he does so, he must be held to have discharged his burden but if he fails to offer an explanation on the basis of facts within his special knowledge, he<span style="text-decoration: underline"> fails to discharge</span> the burden cast upon him by Section 106. [Source: Sarkar on Law of Evidence, 20th Edition, Volume 2.] </li>
<li class="has-small-font-size">12.12. In Sushil Kumar vs. Rakesh Kumar (supra), the controversy was with regard to the <span style="text-decoration: underline">improper acceptance of the nomination</span> of the sole respondent therein on the premise that he was under qualified to contest the Bihar Legislative Assemble election from 181, Parbatta Constituency. In the said case, inter alia, the horoscope of the respondent therein and admission register of New St. Xaviers School, Boring Road, Patna and transfer certificate issued by Swami Vivekananda Vidyalaya, Mithapur, Patna, were produced as documents to prove that the successful candidate therein was not eligible to contest the said Assembly election. In the said case, Section 35 of the Indian Evidence Act was referred to and it was observed that the <span style="text-decoration: underline">register maintained in terms of a statute or by a statutory authority in regular course of business would be a relevant fact</span> and if such vital evidence had been produced, it would clinch the issue. It was observed that there is <span style="text-decoration: underline">no reliable evidence on record </span>to show that the date of birth was recorded in the school register on the basis of the statement of any responsible person and that the <span style="text-decoration: underline">admission register or a transfer certificate issued by a primary school do not satisfy the requirements of Section 35</span> of the Evidence Act.</li>

<p>In Narendra Singh Panwar v. The State of Madhya Pradesh, 2021  Cr LJ 934, it is observed as to Blood Group as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li class="has-small-font-size">“27. Thus it is proved that there was one commonality of blood group between the clothes of both the appellants (accused) and the handkerchief found on the spot.</li>
<li class="has-small-font-size">28. Learned counsel submits that the prosecution has not proved that the blood group of the deceased was also of ‘B’ group. This submission is not acceptable. <span style="text-decoration: underline">Onus now shifted upon the accused persons to show that their own blood group was not of ‘B’ group</span>. The Supreme Court in the case of A. Raghavamma vs. A. Chenchamma in AIR 1964 S.C. 136 has held as under :-
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li class="has-xs-font-size">“1 to 12……. There is an essential distinction between burden of proof and onus of proof, burden of proof lies upon the person who has to prove a fact and it never shifts, but the onus of proof shifts. …..” </li>

<p>In a suit for recovery on title, where both plaintiff and defendant claim title, if <span style="text-decoration: underline"><mark class="has-inline-color has-foreground-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">plaintiff has been able to create a high degree of probability</mark></span>, he will Win,  if the defendant fails to discharge his onus. In <strong>R.V.E. Venkatachala Gounder v. Arulmigu Viswesaraswami</strong>, AIR 2003 SC 4548: (2003) 8 SCC 752, the law is stated in the following terms :</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“29. In a suit for recovery of possession based on title it <span style="text-decoration: underline">is for the plaintiff to prove his title</span> and satisfy the court that he, in law, is entitled to dispossess the defendant from his possession over the suit property and for the possession to be restored to him. However, as held in A. Raghavamma v. A. Chenchamma there is an essential distinction between burden of proof and onus of proof: burden of proof lies upon a person who has to prove the fact and which never shifts. Onus of proof shifts. Such a shifting of onus is a continuous process in the evaluation of evidence.

</ul>
<p>In Smriti Debbarma v. Prabha Ranjan Debbarma, 2023 SCC OnLine SC 9,it is held bu our Apex Court as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“31. The burden of proof
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li class="has-xs-font-size">[See Paragraph 19 in Anil Rishi v. Gurbaksh Singh, (2006) 5 SCC 558 where the expression ‘burden of proof’ is used in three ways, namely, (i) to indicate the duty of bringing forward evidence in support of a proposition at the beginning or later; (ii) to make that of establishing a proposition as against all counter-evidence; and (iii) an indiscriminate use in which it may mean either, or both of the others.]</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>to establish a title in the present case lies upon the plaintiff as this burden lies on the party who asserts the existence of a particular state of things on the basis of which she claims relief [See Addagada Raghavamma and Another v. Addagada Chenchamma and Another, AIR 1964 SC 136.] This is mandated in terms of Sec. 101
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li class="has-xs-font-size">[Sec. 101: Burden of Proof.- Whoever desires any Court to give judgment as to any legal right or liability dependent on the existence of facts which he asserts, must prove that those facts exist. When a person is bound to prove the existence of any fact, it is said that the burden of proof lies on that person.]</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>of the Evidence Act, which states that burden on proving the fact rests with party <span style="text-decoration: underline">who substantially asserts in the affirmative and not on the party which is denying it</span>. This rule may not be universal and has exceptions,[See Ss. 103, 104 and 105 of the Evidence Act.] but in the factual background of the present case, the general principle is applicable. In terms of Sec. 102
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li class="has-xs-font-size">[Sec. 102: On whom the burden of proof lies.- The burden of proof in a suit or proceeding lies on that person who would fail if no evidence at all were given on either side.]</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>of the Evidence Act, <span style="text-decoration: underline">if both parties fail to adduce evidence</span>, the suit must fail.[See Anil Rishi v. Gurbaksh Singh, (2006) 5 SCC 558.] <mark class="has-inline-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#1a0eee">Onus of proof, no doubt shifts and the shifting is a continuous process in the evaluation of evidence, but this happens when <strong>in a suit for title and possession</strong>, the <strong>plaintiff has been able to create a <span style="text-decoration: underline">high degree of probability</span></strong> <strong>to shift the onus on the defendant</strong>.</mark> In the absence of such evidence, the burden of proof lies on the plaintiff and <span style="text-decoration: underline">can be discharged only when he is able to prove title</span>.[See R.V.E. Venkatachala Gounder  v. Arulmigu Viswesaraswami  V.P. Temple and Another, (2003) 8 SCC 752.] ……</li>
<li>Therefore, it follows that the plaintiff should have satisfied and discharged the burden under the provisions of the Evidence Act, failing which the suit would be liable to be dismissed.”</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><u>Burden of proof and Onus of proof</u></strong></p>
<p>The Supreme Court in the case of <strong>Gian Chand and Bros v. Rattan Lal</strong>, (2013) 2 SCC 606, has held as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>18. It is well-settled principle of law that a person <span style="text-decoration: underline">who asserts </span>a particular fact is required to affirmatively <span style="text-decoration: underline">establish it</span>. In Anil Rishi v. Gurbaksh Singh [(2006) 5 SCC 558] (SCC p. 561, para 9), it has been held that the burden of proving the facts rests on the party who substantially asserts the affirmative issues and <span style="text-decoration: underline">not the party who denies it</span> and the said principle may <span style="text-decoration: underline">not be universal</span> in its application and there may be an exception thereto. The purpose of referring to the same is that if the plaintiff asserts that the defendant had acknowledged the signature, it is obligatory on his part to substantiate the same. But the question would be what would be the consequence in a situation where the signatures are proven and there is an evasive reply in the written statement and what should be construed as substantiating the assertion made by the plaintiff.</li>
<li>19. In Krishna Mohan Kul v. Pratima Maity [(2004) 9 SCC 468] it has been ruled thus: (SCC p. 474, para 12) “12. … When <span style="text-decoration: underline">fraud, misrepresentation or undue influence</span> is alleged by a party in a suit, normally, the burden is on him to prove such fraud, undue influence or misrepresentation.”</li>
<li>20. In Shashi Kumar Banerjee v. Subodh Kumar Banerjee [AIR 1964 SC 529] a Constitution Bench of this Court, while dealing with a mode of proof of a will under the Succession Act, 1925 observed that where the caveator alleges <span style="text-decoration: underline">undue influence, fraud and coercion, the onus is on him</span> to prove the same.</li>
<li>21. In A. Raghavamma v. A. Chenchamma [AIR 1964 SC 136], while making a distinction between <strong><u>burden of proof and onus of proof</u></strong>, a three-Judge Bench opined thus: (AIR p. 143, para 12) “12. … There is an essential distinction between burden of proof and onus of proof: burden of proof lies upon the person who has to prove a fact and it never shifts, but the onus of proof shifts. The burden of proof in the present case undoubtedly lies upon the plaintiff to establish the factum of adoption and that of partition. The said circumstances do not alter the incidence of the burden of proof. Such considerations, having regard to the circumstances of a particular case, may shift the onus of proof. Such a shifting of onus is a continuous process in the evaluation of evidence.”</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">‘Onus Probandi’ and Sec. 106 of the Evidence Act</span></strong></p>
<p>The Latin maxim, Onus Probandi, means ‘burden of proof’.  This maxim generally conveys the rule and idea that one who asserts a positive fact has to prove it.</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Sec. 101 to 103 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872, deal with the burden of proof in general. Sec. 104 to 106 deal with specific situations.</li>
</ul>
<p>In an election case, referring Sec. 106 and Sec. 114 of the Evidence Act, the Supreme Court reversed the judgment of the High Court, in Puneet Rai vs. Dinesh Chaudharv. (2003) 8 SCC 204, observing that the onus was on the respondent to prove that he belongs to ‘Passi’ community which falls in the Schedule caste category.</p>
<p>In  Sushil Kumar v. Rakesh Kumar, (2003) 8 SCC 673, the Supreme Court reversed the decision of the High Court finding that the burden of proving the age of the elected candidate (above 25 years) was upon him. The Apex Court held as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li class="has-small-font-size">“28. It is no doubt true that the burden of proof to show that a candidate who was disqualified as on the date of the nomination would be on the election petitioner.</li>
<li class="has-small-font-size">29. It is also true that the initial burden of proof that nomination paper of an elected candidate has wrongly been accepted is on the election petitioner.</li>
<li class="has-small-font-size">30. In terms of Section 103 of the Indian Evidence Act, however, the burden of proof as to any particular fact lies on that person who wishes the Court to believe in its existence, unless it is provided by any law that the proof of that fact shall lie on any particular person.</li>
<li class="has-small-font-size">31. Furthermore, in relation to certain matters, the fact being within the special knowledge of the respondent, the burden to prove the same would be on him in terms of Section 106 of the Indian Evidence Act. However, the question as to whether the burden to prove a particular matter is on the plaintiff or the defendant would depend upon the nature of the dispute.</li>
<li class="has-small-font-size">32. The age of a person, in an election petition has to be determined not only on the basis of the materials placed on records but also upon taking into consideration the circumstances attending thereto. The initial burden to prove the allegations made in the election petition although was upon the election petitioner but for proving the facts which were within the special knowledge of the respondent, the burden was upon him in terms of Section 106 of the Evidence Act. It is also trite that when both parties have adduced evidence, the question of onus of proof becomes <span style="text-decoration: underline"><mark class="has-inline-color has-primary-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><strong>academic</strong></mark></span> [See Union of India and Others vs. Sugauli Sugar Works (P) Ltd., (1976) 3 SCC 32,(Para 14) and M/s Cox and Kines (Azents) Ltd. vs. Their Workmen and Others, AIR 1977 SC 1666, (Para 36)]. Furthermore, an admission on the part of a party to the lis shall be binding on him and in any event a presumption must be made that the same is taken to be established.”</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">‘Onus Probandi’ and Rule of ‘Best Evidence’</span></strong></p>
<p>Rule of ‘Best Evidence’ requires a party to suit to produce all material evidence with him. If he f<span style="text-decoration: underline">ails to produce the best evidence</span>, then illustration ‘g’ of Section 114 Evidence Act allows the court to take the presumption that, if that evidence had been produced, it would have been unfavourtable to him. In Dharampal v. State of Haryana (P&amp; H, 2020), it is observed as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li class="has-small-font-size">“20. Chapter VII in Part-Ill of the Evidence Act, 1872 examines the burden of proof and onus of proof or “onus probandi”. Section 101 lays down that whosoever, wants the court to give judgment as to any legal right or liability dependent on the existence of fact, which he asserts, must prove that those facts exist. However, Section 106 provides that any fact which is essentially within the knowledge of any person, the burden of proving that fact is upon him. Illustration-b to Section 106 specifically provides that if A is charged with travelling on a railway train without ticket, the burden of proving that he had bought a ticket is on the person who was found travelling. Still further, illustration ‘g’ of Section 114 require production of <span style="text-decoration: underline">best evidence</span> before the Court/authority. It lays down that the evidence which could be but is not produced, would be deemed to be unfavourable to the person who holds it from the Court/authority. It means that if a person f<span style="text-decoration: underline">ails to produce the best evidence </span>which he could produce then the presumption would be that the aforesaid evidence, if had been produced, would be unfavourtable to the person, who withholds it.”</li>
