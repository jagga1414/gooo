<p>According to the Indian Evidence Act (Sec. 3) ‘Evidence’ means and includes all statements made before the courts by witnesses, and all documents including electronic records produced in the Court. The ‘best evidence rule’ is laid down, in-particular, in Sec. 60 and 61 of the Evidence Act (oral evidence must be direct; and contents of documents are to be proved either by primary or by secondary evidence). </p>
<p><strong><u>Oral Evidence must be Direct</u></strong></p>
<p>Sec. 60 of the Evidence Act   directs that the oral evidence must be direct; that is to say: </p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>if it refers to a fact which could be seen, it must be the evidence of a witness who says he saw it;</li>
<li>if it refers to a fact which could be heard, it must be the evidence of a witness who says he heard it;</li>
<li>if it refers to a fact which could be perceived by any other sense or in any other manner,</li>
<li>it must be the evidence of a witness who says he perceived it by that sense or in that manner;</li>
<li>if it refers to an opinion or to the grounds on which that opinion is held, it must be the evidence of the person who holds that opinion on those grounds.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration:underline">Documents must be Proved by Primary Evidence</span></strong></p>
<p>Sec. 61 of the Evidence Act directs that the contents of documents may be proved either by primary or by secondary evidence. Best evidence rule insists for primary evidence when original documents exists; and Sec. 64 stipulates that documents must be proved by primary evidence except in the cases mentioned in Sec.65.  Sec. 65 clause (a) to (g) delineates the cases in which secondary evidence relating to documents may be given.</p>
