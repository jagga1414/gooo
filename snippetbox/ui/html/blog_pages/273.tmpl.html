It was held as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“18. The statement of law expounded by Viscount Simon, L.C. in the case of Heyman as noticed above, in our view, equally applies to situation where the <span style="text-decoration: underline">contract is terminated by one party on account of the <strong>breach </strong>committed by the other</span> particularly in a case where the clause is framed in wide and general terms. Merely because the contract has come to an end by its termination due to breach, the <span style="text-decoration: underline">arbitration clause <strong>does not get perished</strong></span> nor rendered inoperative; rather it survives for resolution of disputes arising “in respect of” or “with regard to” or “under” the contract. This is in line with the earlier decisions of this Court, particularly as laid down in Kishori Lal Gupta &amp; Bros.”</li>
</ul>
<p>It is legitimate to say that <span style="text-decoration: underline">this position does not continue</span> in view of the amended provisions, after 2015.</p>
<p>If the Contract (with arbitration clause) says that the contract will “stand cancelled”  or “become void” or “come to an end”, on breach of that contract, whether the arbitration clause will work in such a case, for fixing damages, may be, still, a matter of adjudication by the arbitrator.

<p><strong><u>Arbitration Clause in a Perished/Expired Contract, Arbitrator Not Appointed</u></strong></p>
<p>Relying on Union of India v. Kishorilal Gupta and Bros., AIR 1959 SC 1362, it is held in Eigen Technical Service Pvt.  Ltd.  v. Vatika Limited,  2013-172 Pun LR  27: 2013-4 Arb LR 367, that <strong><u>arbitration clause in a</u></strong> redundant and <strong>perished</strong> <strong>contract</strong>by efflux of time, <strong><u>cannot be invoked</u></strong>. The court relied on an Allahabad decision stating as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“High Court of Allahabad in a judgment dated 10.11.2006 passed in Writ Petition No. 21275 of 2006 titled as Union of India Thru. Secry., Ministry of Postal v.

<li>For appointing an arbitrator, Courts shall make a Prima Facie ‘finding’ under Sec. 11(6A) as to “Non­-arbitrability of disputes”; and </li>

<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“133. <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">Prima facie case</span></strong> in the context of Section 8 is not to be confused with the merits of the case put up by the parties which has to be established before the Arbitral Tribunal. It is restricted to the subject-matter of the suit being prima facie arbitrable under a valid arbitration agreement. <span style="text-decoration: underline">Prima facie case means that the assertions on these aspects are bona fide.</span></li>
<li>134. Prima facie examination is <span style="text-decoration: underline">not full review but</span> a primary first review <span style="text-decoration: underline">to</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>weed out</strong> manifestly and ex facie <strong>non-existent and invalid arbitration agreements</strong> and n<strong>on-arbitrable disputes</strong>.</span> The prima facie review at the reference stage is to cut the <strong>deadwood</strong> and trim off the side branches in straight forward cases where dismissal is barefaced and pellucid and when on the facts and law the litigation must stop at the first stage. <span style="text-decoration: underline">Only when</span> the court is certain that <span style="text-decoration: underline">no valid arbitration agreement exists or t</span>he disputes/subject-matter are <span style="text-decoration: underline">not arbitrable, the application</span> under Section 8 would<span style="text-decoration: underline"> be rejected</span>. At this stage, the court should <span style="text-decoration: underline">not</span> get lost in thickets and <span style="text-decoration: underline">decide debatable questions of facts.</span> Referral proceedings are preliminary and summary and not a mini trial… …</li>
<li>139. … Conversely, if the court becomes too reluctant to intervene, it may undermine effectiveness of both the arbitration and the court. There are <span style="text-decoration: underline">certain cases where the prima facie examination may require a deeper consideration</span>. The court’s challenge is to find the right amount of and the context when it would examine the prima facie case or exercise restraint. The legal order needs a right balance between avoiding arbitration obstructing tactics at referral stage and protecting parties from being forced to arbitrate when the matter is clearly non-arbitrable.”</li>

<p>The Apex Court further observed as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">

SPML Infra Ltd.</mark>, 2023 SCC OnLine SC 389, without changing the foundations laid down by the Apex Court in earlier decisions,  Dr. DY Chandrachud; CJI, made clear the position of law with clarity and emphasis. It is observed as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“24. Following the general rule and the principle laid down in Vidya Drolia (supra), this Court has consistently been holding that the arbitral tribunal is the preferred first authority to determine and decide all questions of non-arbitrability. In Pravin Electricals Pvt. Ltd. v. Galaxy Infra and Engg. Pvt. Ltd., (2021) 5 SCC 671, Sanjiv Prakash v. Seema Kukreja, (2021) 9 SCC 732, and Indian Oil Corporation Ltd. v. NCC Ltd., (2022) SCC OnLine SC 896, the parties were referred to arbitration, as the prima facie review in each of these cases on the objection of non-arbitrability was found to be inconclusive. Following the exception to the general principle that the court may not refer parties to arbitration when it is clear that the case is manifestly and ex facie non-arbitrable, in BSNL and Anr. v. Nortel Networks India (P) Ltd., (2021) 5 SCC 738, and Secunderabad Cantonment Board v. B. Ramachandraiah , arbitration was refused as the claims of the parties were demonstrably time-barred.</li>
<li>25. <span style="text-decoration: underline">Eye of the Needle</span>: The above-referred precedents crystallise the position of law that the <span style="text-decoration: underline">pre-referral jurisdiction of the courts under Section 11(6) of the Act is very narrow</span> and inheres two inquiries. The primary inquiry is about the <span style="text-decoration: underline"><mark class="has-inline-color has-primary-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><strong>existence</strong> </mark>and the <mark class="has-inline-color has-primary-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><strong>validity</strong></mark> of an arbitration agreemen</span>t, which also includes an inquiry as to the parties to the agreement and the applicant’s privity to the said agreement. These are matters which require a thorough examination by the referral court. The secondary inquiry that may arise at the reference stage itself is with respect to the non- arbitrability of the dispute.</li>
<li>26. As a general rule and a principle, the arbitral tribunal is the preferred first authority to <span style="text-decoration: underline">determine and decide all questions of non-arbitrability</span>. …</li>
<li>27. The standard of scrutiny to examine the non-arbitrability of a claim is <span style="text-decoration: underline">only prima facie</span>. Referral courts must not undertake a full review of the contested facts; they must only be confined to a primary first review and let facts speak for themselves. This also requires the courts to examine whether the assertion on arbitrability is <span style="text-decoration: underline">bona fide or not</span>. The prima facie scrutiny of the facts must lead to a clear conclusion that there is not even a vestige of doubt that the claim is non-arbitrable. On the other hand, <strong><mark class="has-inline-color has-primary-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">even if there is the slightest doubt, the rule is to refer the dispute to arbitration</mark></strong>.</li>
<li>28. <span style="text-decoration: underline">The limited scrutiny</span>,<span style="text-decoration: underline"> through the </span><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">eye of the needle</span></strong>, <span style="text-decoration: underline">is <strong><mark class="has-inline-color has-primary-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">necessary and compelling</mark></strong></span>. It is intertwined with the duty of the referral court to protect the parties from being forced to arbitrate when the matter is demonstrably non-arbitrable. It has been termed as a legitimate interference by courts to refuse reference in order to prevent wastage of public and private resources. Further, as noted in Vidya Drolia (supra), if this duty within the limited compass is not exercised, and the Court becomes too reluctant to intervene, it may undermine the effectiveness of both, arbitration and the Court. Therefore, this Court or a High Court, as the case may be, while exercising jurisdiction under Section 11(6) of the Act, is <span style="text-decoration: underline">not expected to act mechanically merely</span> to deliver a purported dispute raised by an applicant at the doors of the chosen arbitrator, as explained in DLF Home Developers Limited v. Rajapura Homes Pvt. Ltd., 2021 SCC OnLine SC 781″</li>
</ul>
<p>In BSNL and Anr. v. Nortel Networks India (P) Ltd., (2021) 5 SCC 738, it is held held as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“45.1 …While exercising jurisdiction under Section 11 as the judicial forum, the <span style="text-decoration: underline">court may exercise the prima facie test to screen and knockdown ex facie meritless, frivolous, and dishonest litigation</span>. Limited jurisdiction of the courts would ensure expeditious and efficient disposal at the referral stage. At the referral stage, the Court can interfere “only” when it is “manifest” that the claims are ex facie time-barred and dead, or there is no subsisting dispute…” (quoted and followed in <mark class="has-inline-color has-primary-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">NTPC Ltd. v.

<p><strong><u>N.N. Global Mercantile v. Indo Unique Flame –</u></strong> <strong><u>Contentions, in Substance</u></strong></p>
<p>The legal disputes in <strong>N.N. Global Mercantile (P) Ltd. v. Indo Unique Flame Ltd., 2023 SCC OnLine SC 495</strong>, was placed before the Apex Court, treading following course:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>A suit was filed by the appellant, to enforce a contract.</li>
<li>The defendant applied for reference under Section 8 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, the contract being contained an arbitration clause.</li>
<li>Trial Court rejected the application.</li>
<li>A Writ Petition was filed by the defendant challenging the Order. It was contended that the Arbitration Agreement was unenforceable as the (main) contract was unstamped.</li>
<li>The High Court allowed the Writ Petition. (Hence the plaintiff became the appellant before the Supreme Court.)</li>
</ul>
<p>It was argued before the Apex Court that the Arbitration Agreement in the contract was enforceable and could have been acted upon, even if the contract was unstamped and unenforceable under the Indian Stamp Act. The 2-Judge Bench of the Supreme Court, referred the matter to 3-Judge Bench.</p>
<p>The 3-Judge Bench of the Supreme Court, referred the case to 5-Judge Bench, pointing out that an arbitration clause would stand as a distinct, separate and independent from the substantive contract.  This is based on the doctrine of severability or separability. That is, when the parties enter into such a contract, there are two separate agreements,</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>(i) the substantive contract and</li>
<li>(ii) the arbitration agreement.</li>
</ul>
<p>In this premise, the 3-Judge Bench opined as under: </p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Even if the main contract was bad for it was unstamped or insufficiently stamped, the arbitration clause could be enforced.</li>
<li>The defect on insufficiency of stamp could be cured as provided in the Stamp Act, and therefore, it could not be said that an unstamped or insufficiently stamped instrument did not exist in the eye of the law.</li>
<li>The failure to stamp a document, did not affect the validity or unenforceability of the document, but it merely rendered the document inadmissible in evidence.</li>
</ul>
<p>Before the 5-Judge Bench of the Supreme Court, it was argued –</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>by the respondents/defendants, on the basis of the relevant provisions of the <strong>Arbitration Act</strong> (<strong><u>especially Sec. 16</u></strong>), that an arbitration clause would stand as a distinct, separate and independent from the substantive contract and that an arbitration reference can be made by the court even if the arbitration agreement was insufficiently stamped; and</li>
<li>by the appellant/plaintiff, in view of the provisions in the <strong>Indian Stamp Act</strong> (<strong><u>especially Sec. 33 and 35</u></strong>), that the arbitration reference could not be made by the court on the basis of an insufficiently stamped agreement. It was pointed out that unstamped or insufficiently stamped documents cannot be used as evidence for any purpose, as provided in the Stamp Act; and that for reference under Sec. 8 of the Arbitration Act the court has to specifically <mark class="has-inline-color has-primary-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><strong><mark class="has-inline-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#0500db">find</mark></strong><mark class="has-inline-color has-primary-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><strong> </strong></mark><strong><mark class="has-inline-color has-foreground-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">that</mark></strong><mark class="has-inline-color has-primary-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><strong> </strong></mark><strong><em><mark class="has-inline-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#000adb">prima facie</mark></em></strong><mark class="has-inline-color has-primary-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><strong> </strong></mark></mark><strong><mark class="has-inline-color has-foreground-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">a</mark></strong><mark class="has-inline-color has-primary-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><mark class="has-inline-color has-primary-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><strong> </strong></mark><strong><mark class="has-inline-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#0011db">“valid</mark></strong><mark class="has-inline-color has-primary-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><strong> arbitration agreement </strong></mark><strong><mark class="has-inline-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#0500db">exists</mark></strong></mark>“..</li>

</ul>
<p>The majority judgment Para 110 and 111 of N.N. Global Mercantile (P) Ltd. v. Indo Unique Flame Ltd., 2023 SCC OnLine SC 495, reads as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“110. An instrument, which is eligible to stamp duty, may contain an Arbitration Clause and which is not stamped, cannot be said to be a contract, which is enforceable in law within the meaning of Section 2(h) of the Contract Act and is not enforceable under Section 2(g) of the Contract Act. An <strong>unstamped</strong> instrument, when it is required to be stamped, being not a contract and <strong>not enforceable</strong> in law, cannot, therefore, <strong>exist </strong>in law. Therefore, we approve of paragraphs-22 and 29 of Garware (supra). To this extent, we also approve of Vidya Drolia (supra), insofar as the reasoning in paragraphs-22 and 29 of Garware (supra) is approved.</li>
<li>111. The true intention behind the <strong><u>insertion of Section 11(6A)</u></strong> in the Act was to confine the Court, acting under Section 11, to examine and ascertain about the <strong>existence</strong> of an Arbitration Agreement.”<strong><u></u></strong></li>

<p><strong><u>Effect of Fraud on Arbitration Agreement</u></strong></p>
<p>In A. Ayyasamy v. A. Paramasivam, (2016) 10 SCC 386, it was held as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“25. ……..It is only in those cases where the court, while dealing with Section 8 of the Act, finds that there are very serious allegations of fraud which make a virtual case of criminal offence  or where allegations of fraud are so complicated that it becomes absolutely essential that such complex issues can be decided only by the civil court on the appreciation of the voluminous evidence that needs to be produced, the court can sidetrack the agreement by dismissing the application under Section 8 and proceed with the suit on merits. It can be so done also in those cases where there are serious allegations of forgery/fabrication of documents in support of the plea of fraud or where fraud is alleged against the arbitration provision itself or is of such a nature that permeates the entire contract, including the agreement to arbitrate, meaning thereby in those cases where f<span style="text-decoration: underline">raud goes to the validity of the contract itself of the entire contract which contains the arbitration clause or the validity of the arbitration clause itself</span>…….”. (Quoted in: Zenith Drugs &amp; Allied Agencies Pvt. Ltd. v. Nicholas Piramal India Ltd., AIR 2019 SC 3785, 2020-17 SCC 419)</li>
</ul>
<p>It was pointed out in Zenith Drugs &amp; Allied Agencies Pvt. Ltd. v. Nicholas Piramal India Ltd., AIR 2019 SC 3785, 2020-17 SCC 419, that the plea of fraud being raised in entering the compromise, the merits of such a plea could be decided only by the Civil Court upon consideration of the evidence adduced by the parties.</p>
<p><strong><u>Validity Decided by Court; Arbitrators have no Conclusive Power</u></strong></p>
<p>In <span style="text-decoration: underline">Uttar Pradesh Rajkiya Nirman Nigam Limited v. Indure Private Limited, 1996-2 SCC 667</span>: AIR 1996 SC 1373, it is held (even prior to 2015 Amendment)  as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>14.</strong> In “Law of Arbitration” by Justice Bachawat (2nd Edn.) at page 155 it is stated that
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“the question whether matters referred to were within the ambit of clause for reference of any difference or dispute which may arise between the parties, it is for the Court to decide”. ….</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>15.</strong> The clear settled law thus is that the <strong><u>existence or validity of an arbitration agreement shall be decided by the Court alone</u></strong>. Arbitrators, therefore, have no power or jurisdiction to decide or adjudicate <em><u>conclusively</u></em> by themselves the question since it is the very foundation on which the arbitrators proceed to adjudicate the disputes.”</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><u>Conclusion</u></strong></p>
<p>In N.N. Global Mercantile (P) Ltd. v. Indo Unique Flame Ltd., 2023 SCC OnLine SC 495,  it was argued –</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>by one side, on the basis of the relevant provisions of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, that an arbitration reference can be made by the court even if the arbitration agreement was insufficiently stamped; and,</li>
<li>by the other side, in view of the provisions in the Indian Stamp Act, that the arbitration reference could not be made by the court on the basis of an insufficiently stamped agreement.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Majority (3 Judges) pronounced the verdict accepting the latter contention.</p>
<p>Taking note of the divergence in the debated points, among Judges, it is observed by Hrishikesh Roy, J., one of the (two) judges who dissented from the view of the majority, laid down the following-</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li> “… Let our minority opinion (self and Learned Brother Justice Ajay Rastogi, who has written a separate opinion), appeal to the <span style="text-decoration: underline">brooding spirit of the future</span> as <span style="text-decoration: underline">also the powers of the legislature</span> to examine the interplay between the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 and the Indian Stamp Act, 1899; and to emphatically resolve the imbroglio to avoid any confusion in the minds of the stakeholders in the field of arbitration.”</li>
