<p>No easement if:</p>

<li>right claimed is <span style="text-decoration: underline">incidents of ownership</span>.</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline">servient property belongs to him</span>. Easement is a right with conscious knowledge that the servient property does not belong to him. AIR 1966 Raj 265. It must also be with proper animus as to easement: AIR 1973 Mad 173.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><u>The word ‘Servient’ is derived from ‘Serve’</u></strong></p>
<p>Literal meaning of the word ‘servient’ is – subordinate, subservient and subject to another. Etymologically it is derived from ‘servus’ (Latin) meaning – slave or servant.</p>
<p>Sec. 4 Explains ‘Servient Heritages’ as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“<span style="text-decoration: underline">Dominant and <strong>Servient</strong> Heritages and Owners</span><strong>: </strong>The land for the <strong><mark class="has-inline-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#9732f6"><span style="text-decoration: underline">beneficial enjoymen</span></mark></strong><span style="text-decoration: underline"><mark class="has-inline-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#9732f6">t</mark></span> of which the right exists is called the dominant heritage, and the owner or occupier thereof the dominant owner; the land on which the liability is imposed is called the <strong>servient </strong>heritage, and the owner or occupier thereof the servient owner.”</li>
</ul>
<p>Thus, the land upon which the right is claimed is ‘servient’ land. </p>
<p>“<span style="text-decoration:underline"><strong>For the <strong><mark class="has-inline-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#9732f6"><span style="text-decoration: underline">Beneficial Enjoymen</span></mark></strong><span style="text-decoration: underline"><mark class="has-inline-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#9732f6">t</mark></span> of that Land</strong>.</span>“</p>
<p>The most outstanding clause in the definition of easement is “Beneficial Enjoyment”.</p>
<p>Easements are <em>primarily</em> for the <strong><mark class="has-inline-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#9732f6"><span style="text-decoration: underline">beneficial enjoymen</span></mark></strong><span style="text-decoration: underline"><mark class="has-inline-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#9732f6">t</mark></span> of dominant heritage. Easement stands as part and parcel of dominant land. The definition says that an easement is a ‘right which the owner or occupier of certain land possesses, as such’. </p>
<p>“<strong><span style="text-decoration:underline">As Such</span></strong>“</p>
<p>‘As such’ is used for emphasis to convey that easement is <em>essentially</em> connected to the dominant land, and it is <em>inherently</em> for the <mark class="has-inline-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#9732f6"><span style="text-decoration: underline">beneficial enjoymen</span></mark><span style="text-decoration: underline"><mark class="has-inline-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#9732f6">t</mark></span> of annexed/appertained (dominant) land; and <span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>not</strong> a right ‘<strong>in gross</strong>’ (for the benefit of individuals)</span>.</p>
<p><strong><u><strong><u>Profit-a-prendre – Indian Law Varies from</u><span style="text-decoration: underline"> English Law</span></strong></u></strong></p>
<p>Under English Law, an easement is a privilege alone; and profit-a-prendre (right to take) is not an easement. It does not allow “<mark class="has-inline-color has-primary-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Removal and Appropriation</strong></span></mark>” also.  The Indian Easements Act purposefully used “to do something in or upon”, decisively avoiding, ‘to use’ or ‘to enjoy’; because, Indian Law allows ‘<strong>profit-a-prendre</strong>‘ [fishing, pasturing, grass-cutting for thatching, etc.]. It is allowed on Indian situations – but, without conferring substantial interest in the servient land. ‘Profit a predre’ is not appurtenant to any dominant land; and it is a right ‘in gross’ (for the benefit of individuals).</p>
<p>Explanation to Sec. 4 of the Indian Easements Act, 1882 reads as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“Explanation – In the first and second clauses of this section, the expression “land” includes also things permanently attached to the earth; </li>
<li>the expression “<strong><mark class="has-inline-color has-primary-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><span style="text-decoration: underline">beneficial enjoymen</span></mark></strong><span style="text-decoration: underline"><mark class="has-inline-color has-primary-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">t</mark></span>” includes also <mark class="has-inline-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#1106cd">possible convenience, remote advantage, and even a mere amenity</mark>; </li>
<li>and the expression “to do something” includes <mark class="has-inline-color has-primary-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><span style="text-decoration: underline">removal and appropriation</span> </mark>by the dominant owner, for the <strong><mark class="has-inline-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#9732f6"><span style="text-decoration: underline">beneficial enjoymen</span></mark></strong><span style="text-decoration: underline"><mark class="has-inline-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#9732f6">t</mark></span> of the dominant heritage, of any part of the soil of the servient heritage, or anything growing or subsisting thereon.”</li>
</ul>
<p>From the above Explanation it is clear that easement includes appropriation of certain tangible material things or natural resources (<strong><u>Profit-a-Prendre</u></strong>). They are further made clear by the Illustrations to various sections as shown under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Illustn.-(d) of S.4. It speaks as to <strong>Graze cattle, take water</strong> and <strong>fish out</strong> from the tank, <strong>take timber from wood,</strong> <strong>take fallen leaves for manuring</strong>.</li>
<li>Illustn.- (b) of S. 22. It states about <strong>cutting  thatching- grass</strong>. </li>
<li>Illustn.- (a) of S. 24. It refers to easement to <strong>lay pipes</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Hence, it is clear: Easement is not a mere ‘Privilege’; but, it includes:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>limited (legally-recognised) enjoyment /user/interest in serviant heritage, and</li>
<li>a right for (expressly-recognised) profit.</li>
</ul>
<p>Though Profit-a-prendre is allowed by Indian law considering the peculiarities of Indian situations, it is not a corporeal right.  And, it does not allow maintaining a substantial interest over the servient land.  No profit-a-prendre in gross also, i.e., for the benefit of individuals. On a close look, it can be seen that it is substantially related to ‘user’ of servient land.</p>
<p><strong><u>“To do do something &amp; ‘Removal and Appropriation</u></strong>‘</p>
<p>In State of Bihar v. Subodh Gopal Bose, AIR 1968 SC 281, our Apex Court held as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“By the Explanation to Sec. 4 the expression “<strong>to do something</strong>” includes removal and appropriation by the dominant owner, for the <strong><mark class="has-inline-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#9732f6"><span style="text-decoration: underline">beneficial enjoymen</span></mark></strong><span style="text-decoration: underline"><mark class="has-inline-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#9732f6">t</mark></span> of the dominant heritage, of any part of the soil of the servient heritage, or anything growing or subsisting thereon. <span style="text-decoration: underline">A profit-a- prendre is therefore included in the definition of “easement” in Sec. 4 of the Indian Easements Act.</span> But an easement being a right which is super-added to the ordinary common law incidents of the ownership of a dominant tenement, and which connotes a corresponding burden on a servient tenement, can only be created by grant, or by statute.”</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><u>Easement is acquired; not arise out of ‘Express Permission’</u></strong></p>
<p>Sec. 12, Easements Act states that an easement is acquired (under grant, partition or prescription) by the owner of an immovable property. Section 12, Indian Easements Act, 1882 reads as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>12.</strong> Who may acquire easements-An easement may be acquired by the owner of the immovable property for the <strong><mark class="has-inline-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#9732f6"><span style="text-decoration: underline">beneficial enjoymen</span></mark></strong><span style="text-decoration: underline"><mark class="has-inline-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#9732f6">t</mark></span> of which the right is created, or on his behalf, by any person in possession of the same.</li>
<li>One of two or more co-owners of immovable property may, as such, with or without the consent of the other or others, acquire an easement for the <strong><mark class="has-inline-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#9732f6"><span style="text-decoration: underline">beneficial enjoymen</span></mark></strong><span style="text-decoration: underline"><mark class="has-inline-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#9732f6">t</mark></span> of such property.</li>
<li>No lessee of immovable property can acquire, for the <strong><mark class="has-inline-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#9732f6"><span style="text-decoration: underline">beneficial enjoymen</span></mark></strong><span style="text-decoration: underline"><mark class="has-inline-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#9732f6">t</mark></span> of other immovable property of his own, an easement in or over the property comprised in his lease.</li>
</ul>
<p>It is observed by the Apex Court in <strong>Bachhaj Nahar Vs. Nilima Mandal</strong>, AIR 2009 SC 1103, that the claimant of easement (prescription) should plead and prove that the right claimed was enjoyed independent of any agreement with the owner of the property over which the right is claimed, as any user with the express permission of the owner will be a licence and not an easement. </p>
<p><strong><u>Acquisition of Easements –  “Basis of Every Right of Easement is  Grant”</u></strong></p>
<p>The Indian Easements Act, 1882 refers to the different methods by which easements are acquired. They are pointed out (<strong>Ramkanya Bai v. Jagdish</strong>, AIR 2011 SC 3258) to be the following:</p>
<ol class="wp-block-list" start="1" style="list-style-type:1">
<li>easements by <span style="text-decoration:underline">grant</span>: <strong>express grant</strong> by the owner of the servient heritage</li>
<li>easements of <span style="text-decoration:underline">necessity:</span> based on <strong>implied grants</strong> or reservations made by the owner of a servient heritage at the time of transfers or partitions</li>
<li>easements by <span style="text-decoration:underline">prescription:</span> it is <strong>presumed</strong> that it is <span style="text-decoration: underline">acquired</span> by peaceable and open enjoyment, without interruption for twenty years and</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration:underline">custom</span><span style="text-decoration: underline">ary</span> easements: it is <strong>inferred</strong> that it is <span style="text-decoration: underline">acquired</span> by virtue of a local custom.</li>
</ol>
<p>For easement by prescription, it is not necessary that the user should be exclusive, but the claimant should exercise it under some claim existing in his own favour independently of all others.</p>
<p>The origin of all easements is, theoretically, grant by the servient owner. It may be express or implied. It may also be presumed from long user. It is observed in <strong>Sree Swayam Prakash Ashramam v. G. Anandavally Amma</strong>, AIR 2010 SC 622, as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li class="has-small-font-size">“Theoretically all easements have their origin in some sort of grant by the servient owner. The grant may be <span style="text-decoration:underline">express </span>or it may be <span style="text-decoration:underline">implied </span>from the surrounding attendant circumstances and conduct of the parties or it may even be <span style="text-decoration:underline">presumed</span> from long user. In the case of an express grant of easement the limit thereof depends on the words used.”</li>
</ul>
<p>In Lachhi v. Ghansara Singh, AIR 1972 HP 89, it is held as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“The <span style="text-decoration:underline">basis of every right of easement</span> by whatsoever method it may have been acquired, <span style="text-decoration:underline">is theoretically a grant</span> from the servient-owner.
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>It may be <span style="text-decoration:underline">express</span>ed, as is mentioned in Sections 8 to 12 of the Act, or </li>
<li>it may be <span style="text-decoration:underline">implied </span>from the circumstances as in Section 13 of the Act. or </li>
<li>it may be <span style="text-decoration:underline">presumed </span>from long and continued user for a certain period as in Section 15 of the Act, or </li>
<li>it may be <span style="text-decoration:underline">inferred</span> from a long and continued practice of user by a certain class of the public in certain locality.” </li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">Extent of Easement</span></strong> –<span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong> If used for several purposes, inferred for all purposes</strong></span></p>
<p>Generally speaking, law on easement is strict and stand against <strong><em>unreasonably</em></strong> enlarging easements and  imposing additional burthen on servient tenement. </p>
<p>But, in Cowling v Higginson (1838) 4 M &amp; W 245, it was held as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“If a way has been used for several purposes, there <span style="text-decoration: underline">may be a ground for inferring</span> that there is a right of way for all purposes.”</li>
</ul>
<p>At times the courts in India also took a pragmatic stand that easement for one purpose can be changed to another, <span style="text-decoration: underline">provided there is no additional burden</span> (agricultural purposes might be used for the purpose of a factory provided no additional burden). It can be shown that what is prohibited is “<span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>substantial</strong> </span><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">increase</span>” </strong>(as provided in Sec. 29). See:</p>

<p>In Hero Vinoth (Minor) v. Seshammal, (2006) 5 SCC 545, AIR 2006 SC 2234, it is held that an easement by grant would not get extinguished under Section 41 of the Act which relates to an easement of necessity.</p>
<p><strong><u><strong><u>Easement of Necessity</u></strong> is limited to Barest Necessity, however inconvenient it is</u></strong></p>
<p>In Hero Vinoth (Minor) vs. Seshammal, (2006) 5 SCC 545, AIR 2006 SC 2234, our Apex Court held as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“An <strong><u>easement of necessity</u></strong> is one which is not merely necessary for the reasonable enjoyment of the dominant tenement, but one where dominant tenement cannot be used at all without the easement. The burden of the servient owner in such a case is not on the basis of any concession or grant made by him for consideration or otherwise, but it is by way of a legal obligation enabling the dominant owner to use his land. <strong><u>It is limited to the barest necessity</u></strong> <strong><u>however inconvenient it is</u></strong> irrespective of the question whether a better access could be given by the servient owner or not. When an alternate access becomes available, the legal necessity of burdening the servient owner ceases and the easement of necessity by implication of law is legally withdrawn or extinguished as statutorily recognized in Section 41. Such an easement will last only as long as the absolute necessity exists. Such a legal extinction cannot apply to an acquisition by grant and Section 41 is not applicable in such case.”</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><u>Who has the Burden to show Alternate Way </u></strong></p>
<p>In <strong>Sree Swayam Prakash Ashramam v. G. Anandavally Amma</strong>, AIR 2010 SC 622, it is held that the plaintiff claiming easement of necessity or grant has only a primary burden to prove the absence of any alternate pathway. </p>
<p>“In a case where the original plaintiff was claiming easement right either as grant or as of necessity the <span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>plaintiff has only a primary burden </strong>to prove the <strong>absence of any alternate pathway</strong></span>. As the defendants have not proved the existence of any pathway for access to Plaint `A’ schedule property the version of the plaintiff that there is no alternate pathway shall be accepted. … <span style="text-decoration: underline">The defendants have not entered the witness box to disprove the evidence led by the plaintiff.</span>”</p>
<p><strong><u>Who has the Onus to show Alternate Way Could Not be Used ‘As Of Right’</u></strong></p>
<p>When the existence of alternate way is shown by the alleged servient owner of easement of necessity, the onus to prove that the way cannot be used “as of right” is upon the dominant owner. In Antony @ Anthappan v. George,  LAWS(KER) 2012-11-179 it is held by t6he Kerala High Court as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“11. When the existence of an alternate way is shown, the appellants ought to have shown that they could not use it <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">as of right</span></strong>. That is because that is a matter within the knowledge of the appellants. <span style="text-decoration: underline">The appellants did not adduce evidence in that line</span>.”</li>
</ul>
<p>The High Court then remanded the case giving the dominant owners an opportunity to adduce evidence to show that the alternate way was not one which they were entitled to use as of right.</p>
<p><strong><u>Implied Grant and Quasi Easement in a ‘Formed’ Way</u></strong></p>
<p>There could be no implied grant where the easements are not continuous and non-apparent. But, in Sree Swayam Prakash Ashramam v. G. Anandavally Amma, AIR 2010 SC 622, our Apex Court found <strong><u>quasi easement under Section 13(b)</u></strong> of the Indian Easements Act over a way in the following circumstances –</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Though there could be no implied grant where the easements are not continuous and non-apparent, if there is a <strong><u>‘formed road’</u></strong> existing over one part of the tenement for the apparent use of another portion or there is ‘some permanence in the adaptation of the tenement’ from which continuity may be inferred, an exception can be inferred (Annapurna Dutta vs. Santosh Kumar Sett, AIR 1937 Cal.661, B.K. Mukherjee, referred to).</li>
<li>There was <strong>implied grant of ‘B’ schedule property as pathway</strong><strong>,</strong> which can be <strong><u>inferred from the circumstances</u></strong> for the reason that <strong>no other pathway</strong> was provided for access to dominant property and there was <strong>no objection </strong>also to the use of disputed way by the plaintiff.</li>
<li>An <strong>easement may arise by implication</strong>, if the intention to grant can properly be <strong>inferred</strong> either<strong> from</strong> the terms of the grant or the <strong>circumstances</strong>.</li>
<li><strong><u>A trace of the pathway could be presumed</u></strong> to be in existence from the time when the plaintiff acquired the properties by separation of tenements.</li>
<li>Only access to the property was through disputed pathway.</li>
<li>It was required for the reasonable and convenient use of the plaintiff’s property and that on severance of the tenements, <strong><u>plaintiff can be presumed to have got a right over disputed pathway</u></strong> <strong><u>by an implied grant</u></strong> and also an easement of necessity.</li>
<li>The user was not obstructed for very long time.</li>
<li>There was no reason to disbelieve the plaintiff’s version that disputed way was given as grant for his use as he was a close relative of the former.</li>
<li>There was an <strong><u>apparent and continuous use which was necessary for the enjoyment of the `A’ schedule property</u></strong> <strong><u>within the meaning of Section 13(b)</u></strong> of the Indian Easements Act.</li>
<li>The defendants have not entered the witness box to disprove the evidence led by the plaintiff.</li>
<li>Therefore, the plaintiff was entitled to easement right in respect of the pathway.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><u>Pleaded ‘Grant’; Not, Implied Grant – Apex Court, allowed Implied Grant</u></strong></p>
<p>Though the plaintiff pleaded only ‘Grant’, and not, Implied Grant,  our Apex Court,  in Sree Swayam Prakash Ashramam v. G. Anandavally Amma, AIR 2010 SC 622, allowed Implied Grant observing as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“It is true that the defendant/appellant alleged that no implied grant was pleaded in the plaint. The Trial Court, in our view, was justified in holding that such pleadings were not necessary when it did not make a difference to the finding arrived at with respect to the easement by way of grant. Accordingly, there is no substance in the argument raised by the learned senior counsel for the appellants.”</li>

<p><strong>1.</strong> <span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Williams v.

<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>This decision is followed in Jotindra Mohan Mitter v. Probodh Kumar Dutt, AIR 1932 Cal 249, and it was held –</li>
<li>“In ascertaining the extent of the right of user of a road when the condition of the adjoining property has been altered, the fact that there was plenty of room in the road had never been taken into consideration. The right must be measured according to the principle laid down by Wills, J., in Williams v. James [1867] 2 C.P. 577 as a <span style="text-decoration: underline">reasonable use</span> for the purpose of the land in the condition in which it was when the user took place, that is in the case of this mansion, in the state in which it was when the grant was made. <span style="text-decoration: underline">The matter must however be looked at <strong>reasonably</strong>, and no small addition to the house would be improper.</span> Here there had been a very large <strong>increase</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">2. Wimbledon and Putney Commons Conservators v.

<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>This decision is followed in Manchersha Sorabji Shet v. Virijvalavdas Jekisandas, (1926) 28 BomLR 1158, and it was held –</li>
<li>“In Wimbledon and Putney Commons Conservators v. Dixon (1875) 1 Ch D 362 it was held that the immemorial user of a right of way for all purposes for which a road was wanted in the then condition of the property, does not establish a right of way for all purposes in an altered condition of the property where that would impose a greater burden on the servient tenement. Where a road had been immemorially used to a farm not only for usual agricultural purposes, but in certain instances for carrying <span style="text-decoration: underline">building materials to enlarge the farm-house</span> and rebuild a cottage on the farm, and for carting away sand and gravel dug out of the farm, it was decided that those circumstances did not establish a right of way for carting the materials required for building a number of new houses on the land.”</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">3. Corporation of London v. Riggs</span></strong> (1880) 13 Ch. D. 798 held that a right of way of necessity is not a general right “for all purposes”; it is limited to the uses to which it had been put at the time<span style="text-decoration: underline"> when the action first arose or when the way of necessity was create</span>d.</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>This decision is followed in Manchersha Sorabji Shet v. Virijvalavdas Jekisandas, (1926) 28 BomLR 1158, and it was held –</li>
<li>“Again, in Corporation of London v. Riggs (1880) 13 Ch.D. 798 the head-note runs as follows :- Where the owner of a close surrounded by his own land grants the land and reserves the close, the implied right to a way of necessity to and from the close over the land operates by way of re-grant from the grantee of the land, and is<span style="text-decoration: underline"> limited by the necessity which created it</span>.”</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><u>Will Easement of Necessity Ripen into a Prescriptive Easement?</u></strong></p>
<p>In other words-</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Can one claim ‘easement of necessity’ and ‘easement by prescription’ with respect to a (same) way?  </li>
<li>Does a way  that started with minimum width (say a foot-path) under the claim ‘easement of necessity’, and continued with a higher width (so that cars can be taken), in the course of time,  for more than 20 years, will yield or bring-in ‘easement by prescription’?</li>
</ul>
<p>We find answer in negative form in Tanba Nusaji Mahajan v, Pandhari Mahajan, 2004 (6) BomCR 782, 2004 (4) MhLJ 109. It is held as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“10. However, a way of necessity is distinguished from the right of way acquired by prescription and <span style="text-decoration: underline">cannot ripen into a prescriptive easement so long as the necessity continues</span>. A way of necessity arises by virtue of conditions entirely different from easement of way created by prescription. The former arises by implication of law out of the necessities of the case and is based upon principle of law which negative the existence of a way by continuous adverse user. The acquisition of way by adverse user is based upon the theory of the hostility of the use to the title of the person over whose lands it is acquired, while a way of necessity is based upon an implication of an intended grant and the use of it is based entirely upon such implication or consent to its use.”</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><u>“In or upon, or in respect of, certain other land not his own”</u></strong></p>
<p>Easement is a right to do something in or upon land of another. Even if the easement involves ‘construction’, it should be of another; because, Sec. 4: Explanation reads: “land” includes also things permanently attached to earth.</p>
<p>If the subsisting-construction is made by, or it belongs to, dominant owner, no doubt, there will be no easement. [1987 (2) Ker LT 1037 (Bund); AIR 1915 PC 131 (Jetty); AIR 1971 SC 1878]. </p>

<p><strong><u>Easement Not Allows to ‘Enjoy’ After Making a Construction</u></strong><em><strong> o</strong></em><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">r Cultivation</span></strong><em>.</em></p>
<p>Easement is a Right for ‘enjoyment’ of things ‘subsisting’.  It is a Right for limited enjoyment, and advantages arising from its situation; and it does not allow to build-and-enjoy. It is clear from Sec. 7 which indicates that easement is only a right for limited enjoyment of (a) land and (b) advantages arising from its situation. It is also clear from the Scheme of the Act as shown under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>S. 4</strong> An easement is a<em> ‘right </em>which the owner or occupier of certain land possesses’<em> <strong>“as such”</strong></em></li>
<li><strong>S.4: </strong>Illustn. (d):  Graze cattle, take water and fish out from the tank, take timber from wood, take fallen leaves for manuring .</li>
<li><strong>S. 7: </strong>Only a right for limited enjoyment of (a) land &amp; (b) advantages arising from its situation. (It is stated:  Easements are restrictions of (a) Exclusive right (of owner) to enjoy immovable property, (b) Rights to advantages arising from its situation)</li>
<li><strong>S. 12</strong> An easement is acquired by owner an immovable property.</li>
<li><strong>S. 17:</strong> Not a right – to tend to total destruction of the servient tenement. (2003 (1) KLT 320)</li>
<li><strong>S. 21</strong> An easement must not be used for any purpose not connected with enjoyment of the dominant heritage.</li>
<li><strong>S. 22:</strong> Exercise easement – least onerous to servient tenement (Illustn.- b: can cut thatching- grass, not to destroy plants)</li>
<li><strong>S. 23:</strong> Not to make additional burden (Illus.- b: not to advance eaves; Illus.- d: not another pollution)</li>
<li><strong>S. 24:</strong> Secure full enjoyment, but cause as little inconvenience.  Illus. (a) easement to lay pipes</li>
<li><strong>S. 27:</strong> Servient owner is entitled to use – consistent with  easement</li>
<li><strong>S. 28:</strong> Easements of  necessity, Right of way, Other prescriptive rights not to <strong>enlarge</strong> purpose, accustomed user etc.</li>
<li><strong>S. 29:</strong> Dominant owner Cannot substantially <strong>increase</strong> an easement</li>
<li><strong>S. 31:</strong> If excessive user – servient owner may obstruct the user.</li>
<li><strong>S. 43:</strong> Permanent change in the dominant heritage and the burden <strong>increased </strong>– easement is extinguished</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">Easement and</span></strong> <strong><u>Grant</u></strong></p>
<p>The term ‘<strong>Grant’ is used in law</strong> to denote-</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>A generic term to mean ‘transfer’ of immovable property (e.g., sale, lease, gift etc.).</li>
<li>But, it will not be a ‘transfer’ of property; and remain as a concession, permission, settlement, <span style="text-decoration: underline">grant of </span><span style="text-decoration: underline">easement</span> etc., if it is used in place of ‘transfer’, purposefully, to denote a lesser right.</li>
<li>Present, aid, help etc., and the act of a settlor of trust, or of donor of a charity.</li>
<li>A technical term to denote conditional-transfer of lands by sovereign especially when it is purposefully used to differentiate from ‘transfer’ of property.</li>
<li>More than a licence (which does not create an estate or interest) and less than an outright and unconditional ‘transfer’ of property.</li>
</ul>
<p>Characteristics of ‘Grant’</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Usually it denotes a grant by deed.</li>
<li>It can be with or without consideration.</li>
<li>Unless specifically specified, it is creation of an ‘interest’ in property (in case of easement, no interest is created; but only a right of enjoyment). </li>
<li>As long as the conditions are fulfilled, grant is usually irrevocable.</li>
<li>Conditions can also be fixed to limit the period of grant.</li>
<li>Inferior interest, out of an interest retained by the grantor, e.g. the grant of a lease of land by the person holding the freehold. (Collins Dictionary of Law).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">Doctrine of ‘Designed Purpose‘ and Easement of Necessity</span></strong></p>
<p>Easement of necessity can be claimed for effective user of a property, in the ordinary course for its designed purpose, if it is ‘essentially necessary’(with required width – for taking vehicles also – in case of a way).</p>

<p>‘<u style="font-weight: bold">Grant’ – Salmond on Jurisprudence</u></p>
<p>What is <strong><u>‘grant’</u></strong> is stated in Salmond’s Jurisprudence, 12th Edition, at pages 338-339, under the heading ‘The Classes of Agreements’.  According to Salmond  a <strong>grant</strong>–</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>” is an <strong>agreement</strong>“,</li>
<li>“creates a <strong>right</strong>“</li>
<li>is <strong>NOT</strong> “a right <strong>in Personam</strong> between the parties to it”,</li>
<li>examples – “grants of <span style="text-decoration: underline">leases, easements, charges, patents, franchises, licences and so forth</span>“.</li>
</ul>
<p>Salmond distinguishes ‘grant’ from other legal concepts as under.  </p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“…. A <strong>contract</strong> is an agreement which creates an obligation or a<span style="text-decoration: underline"> right in personam</span> between the parties to it. </li>
<li>A <strong><u>grant</u></strong> is an agreement which creates a right of <span style="text-decoration: underline">any other description</span>; examples being grants of <span style="text-decoration: underline">leases, easements, charges, patents, franchises, licences and so forth</span>. </li>
<li>An agreement which transfers a right may be termed generically an <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">assignment</span>. </strong>On which extinguishes a right is a release, discharge, or surrender.” (Quoted in H. Anraj v. Government of Tamil Nadu  (&amp; Shri Dipak Dhar v. The State of West Bengal), AIR 1986 SC 63: (1986) 1 SCC 414.)</li>

<p><strong><u>Should Date of Beginning of 20 Years be pleaded?</u></strong></p>
<p>In Justiniano Antao v. Bernadette B. Pereira, (2005) 1 SCC 471, it was pointed out as follows:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“In order to establish a right by way of prescription to the detriment of the other party, one has to show that the incumbent has been using the land as of right peacefully and openly and without any interruption for the last 20 years. There should be specific pleadings and categorical evidence in general and specifically that since what date to which date one is using the access for the last 20 years.”</li>
</ul>
<p>Kerala High Court, in Soman Nair v. Manoj Kumar, 2014 (P. Bhavadasan, J.) distinguished the decision Justiniano Antao v. Bernadette B. Pereira, observing as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“12. A reading of the decision reported in Justiniano Antao’s case (cited supra) would reveal that the dictum has to be read in the context of facts of the case. That was a case where the Apex Court found that till 1984, the claimant was using another way and only thereafter the claim over the way through servient tenement was made. A vague assertion had been made in the said case that the pathway has been used for a long time. It was under those circumstances, the Apex Court had occasion to hold as mentioned above.</li>
<li>13. In the case on hand, the definite pleading as could be culled out from the written statement and counter claim is that defendants as well as their predecessors-in-interest have been using the pathway in question for a long time in fact for more than 30 years and this is only means of access  to their property.”</li>
</ul>
<p>Pappachan v. Alex, ILR 2023-3 Ker 523; 2023-5 KHC 10, distinguished the decision Justiniano Antao v. Bernadette B. Pereira, observing as under: </p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“24. In Justiniano Antao (supra) there was no pleading by the plaintiff that she used the pathway in question for a period of 20 years. Holding that in the absence of such a pleading which is elementary and essential to claim a prescriptive easement right, the Apex Court held that the date from which the right of way was started to use should have been pleaded. The pleadings set forth by the appellants in this case certainly constitute sufficient pleadings to claim easement by prescription. It is true that they did not plead as to from which date they started using that pathway. They, however, pleaded that for the last more than 35 years they have been using that pathway. In the light of such a specific pleadings the law laid down in Justiniano Antao [(2005) 1 SCC 471] does not disentitle the appellants from claiming the relief.”</li>
