<p><strong><u>Sec. 7(3) of the Arbitration Act – Arbitration arises from a Specific Written Contract</u></strong></p>
<p>In Harsha Construction v. Union of India, (2014) 9 SCC 246, it is held as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>  “18. Arbitration arises from a contract and unless there is a specific written contract, a contract with regard to arbitration cannot be presumed. Sec. 7(3) of the Act clearly specifies that the contract with regard to arbitration must be in writing. Thus, so far as the disputes which have been referred to in Clause 39 of the contract are concerned, it was not open to the Arbitrator to arbitrate upon the said disputes as there was a specific clause whereby the said disputes had been “excepted “. Moreover, when the law specifically makes a provision with regard to formation of a contract in a particular manner, there cannot be any presumption with regard to a contract if the contract is not entered into by the mode prescribed under the Act.</li>

<p><strong><u>Arbitrator NOT to decide Matters which are Not Arbitrable, even if an Issue framed</u></strong></p>
<p>In Harsha Construction v. Union of India, (2014) 9 SCC 246, it is held as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>  “19. If a non­arbitrable dispute is referred to an Arbitrator and even if an issue is framed by the Arbitrator in relation to such a dispute, in our opinion, there cannot be a presumption or a conclusion to the effect that the parties had agreed to refer the issue to the Arbitrator. In the instant case, the respondent authorities had raised an objection relating to the arbitrability of the aforestated issue before the Arbitrator and yet the Arbitrator had rendered his decision on the said “excepted ” dispute. In our opinion, the Arbitrator could not have decided the said “excepted ” dispute. We, therefore, hold that <span style="text-decoration: underline">it was not open to the Arbitrator to decide the issues which were not arbitrable</span>; and <span style="text-decoration: underline">the <strong>award,</strong> so far as it <strong>relates to </strong></span><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">disputes regarding non­arbitrable disputes</span></strong> is concerned, <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">is bad in law </span></strong>and is hereby quashed. ” (Referred to in- Emaar India Ltd.  v.

<p><strong><u>Expiry of Contract <strong><u>by Efflux of Time </u></strong>– Arbitration Clause Cannot be Invoked </u></strong></p>

<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“10. The following principles relevant to the present case emerge from the aforesaid discussion:
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>(1) An arbitration clause is a collateral term of a contract as distinguished from its substantive terms; but nonetheless it is an integral part of it;</li>
<li>(2) <u>however comprehensive the terms of an arbitration clause may be, </u><strong><u>the existence of the contract is a necessary condition for its operation; </u></strong><u>it perishes with the contract</u>;</li>

</ul>

</ul>
<p>The aforesaid Apex Court decision, Union of India v. Kishorilal Gupta and Bros., AIR 1959 SC 1362, was referred to in Union of India v. Jagdish Kaur, AIR 2007 All-  67 as under:  </p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“20. The suit was instituted by the landlady on 1 -7-2004 after expiry of term of agreement. Courts below have rightly held that after expiry of five years, the agreement was non- existent and the arbitration clause was not applicable.

<p>It is beyond doubt that the arbitration clause cannot be invoked in a case where the period of limitation provided for suits is elapsed.</p>
<p>If the period fixed in a contract for sale of a property (where time is essence of contract) is over and the vendor alleges breach from the part of purchaser, there will not be a valid and subsisting contract from the view of the vendor. In such a case –</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>if a dispute arises (even within the limitation period for taking legal action),  the “existence or validity of an arbitration agreement” has to be decided by the Court, for referring the parties to arbitration, under Sec. 8(1), and appointing arbitrator under Sec. 11, of the Arbitration Conciliation Act.  </li>
</ul>
<p><strong><u>Arbitration Clause in an Expired</u></strong> <strong><u>Contract, Cannot be invoked</u></strong></p>
<p>Relying on <strong>Union of India v. Kishorilal Gupta and Bros., AIR 1959 SC 1362 </strong>it is held in Eigen Technical Service Pvt.  Ltd.  v. Vatika Limited,  2013-172 Pun LR  27: 2013-4 Arb LR 367, that one cannot invoke arbitration clause in a redundant, and perished contract by efflux of time. The court relied on an Allahabad decision stating as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“ High Court of Allahabad in a judgment dated 10.11.2006 passed in Writ Petition No. 21275 of 2006 titled as Union of India Thru’ Secry., Ministry of Postal v. Jagdish Kaur has also observed that <span style="text-decoration: underline">arbitration clause contained in an expired agreement is also deemed as expired</span> and is no more valid.”</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><u>Validity of Arbn. Agmnt. Decided by Court; Arbitrators have no Conclusive Power</u></strong></p>
<p>In Uttar Pradesh Rajkiya Nirman Nigam Limited v. Indure Private Limited, 1996-2 SCC 667: AIR 1996 SC 1373, it is held as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>14.</strong> In “Law of Arbitration” by Justice Bachawat (2nd Edn.) at page 155 it is stated that
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“the question whether matters referred to were within the ambit of clause for reference of any difference or dispute which may arise between the parties, it is for the Court to decide”. ….</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>15.</strong> The clear settled law thus is that the <strong><u>existence or validity of an arbitration agreement shall be decided by the Court alone</u></strong>.  Arbitrators, therefore, have no power or jurisdiction to decide or adjudicate <em><span style="text-decoration: underline">conclusively</span></em> by themselves the question since <span style="text-decoration: underline">it is the very foundation</span> on which the arbitrators proceed to adjudicate the disputes.”</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><u>An arbitration clause is to be strictly construed</u></strong></p>
<p>The parties are bound by the clauses in the agreement.  The Court will not rewrite any clause in equity. An arbitration clause is required to be strictly construed. (See: Oriental Insurance Co Ltd. v. Narbheram Power and Steel (P) Ltd., (2018) 6 SCC 534; (Referred to in- Emaar India Ltd.  v. Tarun Aggarwal Projects,  AIR  2022 SC 4678)).</p>
<p>In Rajasthan State Industrial Development and Investment Corporation v. Diamond and Gem Development Corporation Ltd.; (2013) 5 SCC 470, it is held that a party cannot claim anything more than what is covered by the terms of the contract, for the reason that the contract is a transaction between two parties and has been entered into with open eyes and by understanding the nature of contract; and that thus the contract being a creature of an agreement between two or more parties has to be interpreted giving literal meanings unless there is some ambiguity therein. The contract is to be interpreted giving the actual meaning to the words contained in the contract and it is not permissible for the Court to make a new contract, however reasonable, if the parties have not made it themselves. It is further observed that the terms of the contract have to be construed strictly without altering the nature of a contract as it may affect the interest of either of the parties adversely.

<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“45. In view of the above discussion, we would like to propound a four­fold test for determining when the subject matter of a dispute in an arbitration agreement is not arbitrable:</li>
<li>(1) When cause of action and subject­-matter of the dispute relates to <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">actions in rem</span></strong>, that do not pertain to subordinate rights in personam that arise from rights in rem.</li>
<li>(2) When cause of action and subject-­matter of the dispute affects <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">third­party rights</span></strong>; have erga omnes effect; require centralized adjudication, and mutual adjudication would not be appropriate and enforceable;</li>
<li>(3) When cause of action and subject-matter of the dispute relates to <span style="text-decoration: underline">inalienable <strong>sovereign and public interest functions of the State</strong></span> and hence mutual adjudication would be unenforceable;</li>
<li>(4) When the subject-­matter of the dispute is expressly or by necessary implication <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">non­arbitrable as per mandatory statute(s)</span></strong>.</li>
<li>These tests are not watertight compartments; they dovetail and overlap, albeit when applied holistically and pragmatically will help and assist in determining and ascertaining with great degree of certainty when as per law in India, a dispute or subject matter is non­arbitrable. Only when the answer is affirmative that the subject matter of the dispute would be non­arbitrable.</li>
<li>However, the aforesaid principles have to be applied with care and caution as observed in Olympus Superstructures (P) Ltd. Vs. Meena Vijay Khetan and Ors.; (1999) 5 SCC 651: (SCC p. 669, para 35)</li>
<li>“35. …Reference is made there to certain disputes like <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">criminal offences</span></strong> of a public nature, disputes arising out of illegal agreements and disputes relating to status, such as <span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>divorce, which cannot be referred</strong></span> to arbitration. </li>
<li>It has, however, been held that if in respect of facts relating to a <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">criminal matter,</span></strong> <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">say, physical injury, if there is a right to damages for personal injury,</span></strong> then such a dispute <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">can be referred to arbitration</span></strong> (Keir v. Leeman). Similarly, it has been held that a <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">husband and a wife may refer to arbitration </span></strong>the terms on which they shall separate, because they can make a valid agreement between themselves on that matter (Soilleux v. Herbst, Wilson v. Wilson and Cahill v. Cahill). ” (Quoted in- Emaar India Ltd.  v. Tarun Aggarwal Projects,  AIR  2022 SC 4678)</li>

Given the fact that there was no protest or demur raised around the time or soon after the letter of subrogation was signed, that the notice dated 31-3-2011 itself was nearly after three weeks and that the financial condition of the respondent was not so precarious that it was left with no alternative but to accept the terms as suggested, we are of the firm view that the <span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>discharge </strong>in the present case and signing of letter of subrogation were not because of exercise of any undue influence</span>. Such discharge and signing of letter of subrogation was voluntary and free from any coercion or undue influence. In the circumstances, we hold that upon execution of the letter of subrogation, there was full and final settlement of the claim. Since our answer to the question, whether there was really accord and satisfaction, is in the affirmative, in our view<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline"> no arbitrable dispute existed</span></strong> so as to exercise power under Section 11 of the Act.

<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“39. It is necessary to define what exactly the Chief Justice, approached with an application under Section 11 of the Act, is to decide at that stage. Obviously, he has to decide his own jurisdiction in the sense, whether the party making the motion has approached the right High Court. He has to decide <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">whether there is an arbitration agreement</span></strong>, as defined in the Act and whether the person who has made the request before him, is a party to such an agreement. It is necessary to indicate that he can also decide the question whether the claim was a <strong><u>dead one;</u></strong> or a <strong>long-barred claim</strong> that was <strong><u>sought to be resurrected</u></strong> and whether the parties have concluded the transaction by recording satisfaction of their mutual rights and obligations or by receiving the <strong><u>final payment without objection.</u></strong>” </li>

The Chief Justice has to decide whether the applicant has satisfied the conditions for appointing an arbitrator under Section 11(6) of the Act. For the purpose of taking a decision on these aspects, the Chief Justice can either proceed on the basis of affidavits and the documents produced or take such evidence or get such evidence recorded, as may be necessary. We think that adoption of this procedure in the context of the Act would best serve the purpose sought to be achieved by the Act of expediting the process of arbitration, without too many approaches to the court at various stages of the proceedings before the Arbitral Tribunal.
