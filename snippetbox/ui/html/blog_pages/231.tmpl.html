<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec. 31, 32 and 33 Stamp Act Analysed </span></strong></p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>1. <span style="text-decoration: underline">Any person</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline">can apply</span></strong> for ‘adjudication’ by Collector. (See: Gujarat Ambuja Cements Limited (Ambuja Cements Limited) v. State of Chhattisgarh (2018).</li>
<li><strong>2. </strong><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Adjudication can be sought for even after the expiry</strong> of one month</span> from the date of its execution (or three months of receipt in India, if executed outside India). </li>
<li><strong>3.  </strong>If the holder of the document <span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>pays the penalty</strong></span> (on its impounding<span style="text-decoration: underline">)</span>, the document will be <span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>treated as a sufficiently stamped</strong> document</span>.</li>
</ul>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>4. <span style="text-decoration: underline">Effect of Limitation Prescribed Under Proviso to Sect. 32</span></strong>: 
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>(i) Under Sec. 32,<strong> if the instrument is brought</strong> to the Collector <strong>within one month</strong> of its execution (or three months, as stated above), the  <strong>Collector has to endorse</strong> the certificate, on payment of the deficit duty, if any; but, <strong>without levying any penalty</strong>.</li>
<li>(ii) What is ‘not authorised’, in <strong>Sec. 32 Proviso</strong>, is that “<em><strong>in this section</strong></em>“; that is, the endorsement under Section 32 – <strong>without imposing any penalty and impounding</strong>. 
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>(Note: This interdiction will not affect grant of certificate even after the stipulated time, if the document is sufficiently stamped, as shown below).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>(iii) The <span style="text-decoration: underline">question of</span> proceeding against a document for levying  <span style="text-decoration: underline">penalty or impounding comes only if</span> it is 
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>(i) produced <span style="text-decoration: underline">after the time limit</span> prescribed </li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>and </strong></span></li>
<li>(ii) <span style="text-decoration: underline">insufficiently stamped</span> (because, for impounding and imposing penalty, the collector has to invoke Sec. 33; it is not done under Sec. 32).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>5.  </strong>The Collector has to <span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>grant the certificate</strong> </span>as to proper stamp even if the document is produced  <span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>after one month</strong></span>  (or three months, as stated above) <span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>if the document is a sufficiently stamped</strong></span> document (without imposing any penalty)-</li>
<li>because,
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline">if only</span> the document is an <span style="text-decoration: underline">insufficiently stamped</span> one, then only the <span style="text-decoration: underline">question of</span> levying  <span style="text-decoration: underline">penalty or impounding comes</span> for consideration (even under Sec. 33);</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline">no time limit for applying adjudication under Sec. 31</span>; and </li>
<li>(as already stated) the interdiction (‘not authorised’) in Sec. 32 Proviso, is as to making the endorsement under Section 32 – <strong>without imposing any penalty and impounding</strong> – for, the proviso speaks as to the actions “<em>in this section</em>” alone.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The afore-stated propositions are explained in the following decisions-</p>
<p>Relying on <strong>Government of Uttar Pradesh v. Raja Mohammed Amir Ahmad Khan</strong>, AIR 1961 SC 787, The Secretary to Government v. The Gwalior Rayon Silk, 1971 Ker LJ 309] and Sethuraman v. Ramanathan, AIR (33) 1946 Mad 437, it is held in  <strong>M.P. Rajeswaran Nair vs The District Collecto</strong>r, 2009 (3) Ker LT 56, as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“ … if an executed instrument is produced before the Collector under Section 31, <span style="text-decoration: underline">within one month</span>, even if the Collector finds that the instrument is insufficiently stamped, the  <span style="text-decoration: underline">instrument would not attract penalty</span>, and the Collector shall make the endorsement under Section 32, if the party pays the deficit stamp </li>
<li>whereas <span style="text-decoration: underline">if it is produced after one month</span>, it would, and the Collector cannot make the endorsement which is the effect of the limitation prescribed under the proviso to Section 32, instead the Collector has to, after adjudication of the proper stamp, <span style="text-decoration: underline">proceed either under Sections 33 and 39 read with Section 4</span>1 or under Section 40 read with Section 41.”</li>
<li>Also see: Ambat Aboobacker v. District Collector (2012, Kerala High Court)</li>
<li>Wilson and Company Private Limited v. K. S. Lokavinayagam,  AIR  1992 Mad 100, (A. R. Lakshmanan, J.)</li>
</ul>
<p>In Sethuraman Chettiar v. Ramanathan Chettiar, AIR 1946 Mad 437, it is held as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“It cannot be said that Sections 31 and 32 contained in Chapter III form one integrated procedure for adjudication to stamps and that the limit referred to in proviso (a) to Section 32 governs applications made under Section 31. Section 31 provides no time limit for an application to the Collector for adjudication as to the proper stamp duty payable in respect of an instrument. <span style="text-decoration: underline">There is nothing in the section to prevent a person from resorting to the Collector for an adjudication as to the proper stamp even after the expiry of one month</span> from the date of its execution. <span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>If the instrument is brought</strong></span> to the Collector <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">within one month</span></strong> of its execution, the applicant would be entitled to have the Collector’s certificate endorsed on the instrument on payment of the deficit duty, if any, but <span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>without having to pay any penalty</strong></span>. But if he seeks the Collector’s adjudication beyond the limit specified in Section 32. <span style="text-decoration: underline">The Collector has, under Section 33, to impound the instrument and proceed under Section 40</span> to decide whether the instrument is duly stamped and to require the payment of the additional duty chargeable in respect of the instrument together with the prescribed penalty in case he is of opinion that it is not duly stamped. On payment of such duty and penalty, a certificate that the proper duty and penalty have been paid has to be endorsed under Section 42 on the instrument which becomes thereupon admissible in evidence and may be acted upon as if it had been duly stamped” (Quoted in: A. Karuppanna Pillai v. Nallathambi, 2000-3 CCC 35, 2000-1 CTC 341.)</li>

<li>(2) For this purpose the Collector may require to be furnished with an abstract of the instrument, and also with such affidavit or other evidence as he may deem necessary to prove that all the facts and circumstances affecting the chargeability of the instrument with duty, or the amount of the duty with which it is chargeable, are fully and truly set forth therein, and may refuse to proceed upon any such application until such abstract and evidence have been furnished accordingly:</li>
<li>Provided that–</li>
<li>(a) no evidence furnished in pursuance of this section shall be used against any person in any civil proceeding, except in an inquiry as to the duty with which the instrument to which it relates is chargeable; and</li>
<li>(b) every person by whom any such evidence is furnished, shall, on payment of the full duty with which the instrument to which it relates, is chargeable, be relieved from any penalty which he may have incurred under this Act by reason of the omission to state truly in such instrument any of the facts or circumstances aforesaid.”</li>
