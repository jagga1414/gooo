</ul>
<p><strong>4. </strong>What is the <span style="text-decoration:underline">purpose of appointing</span> <span style="text-decoration:underline">a commissioner</span>?</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>A commission is issued when it is <span style="text-decoration:underline"><strong>requisite or proper </strong></span>in any suit for the purpose of <strong><span style="text-decoration:underline">elucidatin</span>g</strong> any matter in dispute, etc..  (Subash Soman v. State of Kerala, 2019 -2 Ker HC 700, 2019 -2 Ker LJ 729)</li>
<li>In Bandi Samuel v. Medida Nageswara Rao, 2017 (1) ALT 493 it was pointed out that the <span style="text-decoration:underline">object of appointment</span> of a commissioner was <span style="text-decoration:underline">not to assist a party</span> to collect evidence where the party can procure the same, and that an Advocate Commissioner was appointed, inter alia, for <span style="text-decoration:underline"><strong>elucidating</strong> any matter in dispute</span>; that is <span style="text-decoration:underline">to decide any real controversy </span>between parties.</li>
<li>In New Meena Sahkari Awas Samiti Ltd. v. Addl. District Judge, 2016 (6) AWC 5988, referring the opening words in Rule 9, “in any suit in which the court deems a local investigation to be <span style="text-decoration:underline">requisite or proper</span>“, it is pointed out that the provisions of Order 26 Rule 9 of CPC makes it abundantly clear that an order of issuing Commission for the purposes of<strong> elucidating</strong> matters can be passed <span style="text-decoration:underline">‘only and only in case’ it is <strong>deemed to be requisite or proper</strong> </span>by the court concerned.</li>
<li>In the case of Debendranath Nandi v. Natha Bhuiyan, AIR 1973 Ori 240, it is held that the object of local investigation is to obtain evidence which from its peculiar nature <span style="text-decoration:underline">can best be had from the spot</span>. (see: New Meena Sahkari Awas Samiti Ltd. v. Addl. District Judge, 2016 (6) AWC 5988).</li>
<li>In Haryana Waqf Board v. Shanti Sarup, (2008) 8 SCC 671, it was held that it was appropriate for the lover court to <span style="text-decoration:underline">direct the investigation for demarcation </span>of the disputed land by appointing a Local Commissioner under Order 26 Rule 9 of the CPC for the <span style="text-decoration:underline">dispute in that case was being in respect of the encroachment of the suit land</span> and  an application was filed under Order 26 Rule 9 of the CPC.</li>
<li>In Ushabai Sharadchandra Bannore v. Wasudeo, 2004(2) Mh.LJ 594, it was held that in case of <span style="text-decoration:underline">dispute of an encroachment</span> or dimension of a site, the first essential is to get an agreed map and <span style="text-decoration:underline">if the parties cannot agree on one, a Commissioner must be appointed</span> to prepare the same; and it was held as under: 
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“In the absence of such a map, the decree is probably meaningless and execution means virtually starting the case overall again.”</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>5.</strong> What does the word <span style="text-decoration:underline">‘<mark class="has-inline-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#0c10e1"><strong>Elucidation</strong></mark>‘ denote</span>?</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Make clear by <span style="text-decoration:underline">explanation or analysis</span>; and not mere Collection of evidence.</li>
<li>In New Meena Sahkari Awas Samiti Ltd. v. Addl. District Judge, 2016 (6) AWC 5988, it is observed that the expression ‘elucidate’ means to <span style="text-decoration:underline">make lucid or clear, throw light upon, explain, enlighten</span>.</li>
<li>In Lekh Raj vs Muni Lal, AIR 2001 SC 996, it is held as under:  
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“The <span style="text-decoration:underline">question whether the roof was damaged by the landlord</span> <span style="text-decoration:underline">or</span> was damaged because of the building being <span style="text-decoration:underline">old and dilapidated </span>is a question of fact, proof of it could only be, if at all, through leading evidence and not through a local Commissioner. A local <span style="text-decoration:underline">Commissioner could only report</span> the fact of <span style="text-decoration:underline">existing condition</span> of the building and <span style="text-decoration:underline">not who did it</span>. It was open for him, if appellant so desired for praying to the Court to grant time to lead evidence in this regard. Since court permitted, a local Commissioner to report, so it would have granted the prayers for leading evidence.”</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>6</strong>. Is the Commissioner <span style="text-decoration:underline">enjoined with a role to</span> report matters that are <span style="text-decoration:underline"><strong>relevant</strong></span> in the suit, <span style="text-decoration:underline"><mark class="has-inline-color has-primary-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">even if they are <strong>not specifically put to him</strong></mark></span> (to ascertain)?</p>

<li>Duty of the court cannot be delegated.</li>

<p><strong>8</strong>. <span style="text-decoration:underline">Is there ‘provision’ to raise “<mark class="has-inline-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#170df0"><strong>objection</strong></mark>”</span> to a commission report on ‘local inspection’?</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>No. </li>
<li>But, where an objection is filed by a party, the court cannot ignore it.</li>
<li>O26 r10(2) says:
<ul class="wp-block-list">

</ul>
</li>
<li>There is <span style="text-decoration:underline">no (express) provision in O26 r10(2) for making ‘objection</span> to a Commission report for local inspection’ as provided in O26 r 14 – for Partition.
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><sub><strong>(O26 r 14  – as regards Partition – <strong>says</strong>:  “the Court, after hearing any <span style="text-decoration:underline">objections</span> which the parties may make to the report or reports, shall confirm, vary or set aside the same”)</strong></sub>. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Legislative intent is clear from the aforesaid strong indications – (i) the dissatisfied party has to  <mark class="has-inline-color has-primary-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><span style="text-decoration:underline">examine</span> the Commissioner personally in open Court</mark> under  O26 r 10, and (ii) the court has to ‘hear objections’ in O26 r 14. (Jawahar Lal v. Mangu Ram, (1988) 93 Pun LR 139 ; Balbir Dewan vs Naveen Chander, AIR 1989 Punj. 257).</li>
<li>Commission report accepted without objection of the parties – parties are not precluded from challenging the evidence by cross-examination or giving other evidence : AIR 1966 Orissa 121.</li>
<li>Court is not precluded from examining commissioner even if no objection: 1953 Pat. 133.</li>
<li>CR  in another case can be admitted only on examination of the Commissioner: Sannappa  Vs. Anu Aiah – 1995 AIHC 6680.</li>
<li><strong><span style="text-decoration:underline">Acceptable legal position:</span></strong> </li>
<li>It appears that the acceptable legal position is rendered in Retnamma v. Mehaboob, 2013-3 Civil CC 65 (K Hema, J.), where it is held that the court should go through the report and see whether it was in Order, irrespective of <span style="text-decoration:underline">whether any objection was filed or not</span>; and that the Order 26 Rule 10(3) C.P.C. laid down that where the <span style="text-decoration:underline">Court was dissatisfied</span> with the proceedings of the Commissioner, for any reason, <span style="text-decoration:underline">it might direct the commissioner to make such further inquiry as it thought fit</span>. The Kerala High Court held further as under:
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“60. <span style="text-decoration:underline">If any objection</span> is filed to the commission report by any of the parties, the <span style="text-decoration:underline">court shall necessarily consider the same</span> and pass appropriate order.</li>
<li>68. …. <span style="text-decoration:underline">If there is any merit in the objection raised</span>, it would have been essential that the commission <span style="text-decoration:underline">report be remitted</span> with directions to measure the property etc., and file report i<span style="text-decoration:underline">n which event,</span> <span style="text-decoration:underline">there arises no question of examination of the commissioner</span> to elicit any fact reported by him in the report.</li>

<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>No. </li>
<li>Because, it will be a matter for the Court-determination.

<p>In Indore Development Authority v. Manoharlal, 2020-8 SCC 129, AIR  2020 SC 1496, it is observed:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“270. The decision in Velaxan Kumar (supra) cannot be said to be laying down the law correctly. The Court considered the photographs also to hold that the possession was not taken. <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">Photographs cannot evidence as to whether possession was taken or not</span></strong>. <span style="text-decoration: underline">Drawing of a Panchnama is an accepted mode of taking possession.</span> Even after re-entry, a photograph can be taken; equally, it taken be taken after committing trespass. Such documents cannot prevail over the established mode of proving whether possession is taken, of lands. <span style="text-decoration: underline">Photographs can be of little use, much less can they be a proof of possession.</span> A person may re-enter for a short period or only to have photograph. That would not impinge adversely on the proceedings of taking possession by drawing Panchnama, which has been a rarely recognised and settled mode of taking possession.</li>
<li>271. In the decision in Raghbir Singh Sehrawat v. State of Haryana, (2012) 1 SCC 792 the observation made was that it is not possible to take the possession of entire land in a day on which the award was declared, cannot be accepted as laying down the law correctly and same is contrary to a large number of precedents. The decision in Narmada Bachao Andolan v. State of M.P. (2011) 7 SCC 639, is confined to particular facts of the case. The Commissioner was appointed to find out possession on the spot. DVDs and CDs were seen to hold that the landowners were in possession. The District Judge, Indore, recorded the statements of the tenure-holder. <span style="text-decoration: underline">We do not approve the method of determining the possession by appointment of Commissioner or by DVDs and CDs as an acceptable mode of proving taking of possession</span>. The drawing of Panchnama contemporaneously is sufficient and <strong>it is not open to a court Commissioner to determine the factum of possession within the purview of Order XXVII, Rule 9 CPC. </strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">Whether possession has been taken, or not, is not a matter that a court appointed Commissioner cannot opine</span>. However, drawing of Panchnama by itself is enough and is  a proof of the fact that possession has been taken.”</li>
</ul>
<p>Kerala High Court held in Thomas VY@ Sajimon v. Joseph VY, ILR 2020-3 Ker446,  2020-3 Ker LJ  574, 2020-3 KHC 613, as under: </p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“15. In a suit for permanent prohibitory injunction, the burden is entirely on the plaintiff to bring convincing evidence to show his possession over the plaint schedule property and for so doing, it is not permissible for the plaintiff to invoke Order 26 Rule 9 CPC, which is intended for a different purpose. In a matter relating to the investigation into the disputed question of fact of <strong><u>possession</u></strong>, the power of <span style="text-decoration: underline">appointment of Commissioner for local investigation cannot be exercised by the Court</span> to assist the party to collect evidence, where the party can collect evidence by itself. If a party claims that, that party is in possession of the disputed property and if the other party denies the same by filing the written statement, the disputed fact can be adjudicated by the Court after framing of issues and recording the evidence of the parties. So many articles may be found in the building at the time of local inspection by the Commissioner. Even clothes and other articles may be found in the building. The Commissioner has to just make an inventory of the items found in the building. <span style="text-decoration: underline">The Commissioner cannot report about the ownership of the articles found in the premises</span>, as the said aspect is a matter for evidence. If at all the Commissioner makes any such report, the Court shall not accept the report, even for primary satisfaction without any other convincing material. If the Advocate Commission is deputed for the purpose of ascertaining the possession of the party over the property, the said aspect can be done only after gathering information from the people in the locality, which amounts to fishing out the evidence or gathering of evidence and hence the same is only hearsay information. The party can even otherwise examine the persons, with whom the Commissioner makes enquiry, before the Court to prove the possession of the person over the property in question. <span style="text-decoration: underline">The fishing out of information is to make a local enquiry collecting hearsay materials from the persons gathered there or the like, which is different from collection of materials which he finds at the scene</span>. That apart, if that task is left to be decided by the Advocate Commissioner, any fraudulent litigant can create evidence and with the assistance of the Commissioner, he will be able to prove that he is in possession of the property, which is not the purpose for which Order 26 was enacted. Therefore, <span style="text-decoration: underline">it is always advisable not to appoint an Advocate Commissioner</span>, as in the present case, <span style="text-decoration: underline">to find out the possession of the property</span>, which has to be decided only from oral and documentary evidence to be adduced by the parties. The High Court of Madras in Mr. D. Kuttiyappan v. Meenakshiammal Polytechnic Unit, (2005) 4 MLJ 592, held that the Advocate Commissioner cannot be appointed to note down the factum of possession or the enjoyment . I respectfully agree with the view of the High Court of Madras in D. Kuttiyappan (Supra). Thus, <span style="text-decoration: underline">it is settled law </span>that the power of appointment of <span style="text-decoration: underline">Commissioner for local investigation cannot be exercised by the Court </span>to enable any party <span style="text-decoration: underline">to collect evidence </span>through the Commissioner to prove the <span style="text-decoration: underline">factum of possession</span> or enjoyment. This being the situation, the argument of the learned Counsel for the defendant that the report of the Commissioner would show the possession of the defendant in the plaint schedule property cannot be accepted even for the prima facie satisfaction of the Court.”</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>11. </strong>Will a Commission report be <span style="text-decoration:underline">‘evidence’ even if not marked or exhibited</span>? Can it be marked after trial is over (or at the time of preparing judgment); or, in appeal? </p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Yes.</li>
<li>O 26 r 10 (2) says – ‘The report of the Commissioner and the evidence taken by him shall be evidence in the suit and shall form part of the record.’</li>
<li>In Johnson Kuriakose v. Fr.  Thomas Paul Ramban, 2019 1 KLT 6, it is observed that it is indisputable that the commissioner’s report forms part of the record in the case. Trial <span style="text-decoration: underline">court has every right to look into the materials</span> in the record to decide the disputes. Commissioner’s report <span style="text-decoration: underline">cannot be excluded from consideration</span> in the matter.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>12. </strong>Can Commission Report alone be the <mark class="has-inline-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#1d16f8">basis for decision</mark>?</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>No.</li>
<li>In TK Krishnamurthy  v. Tamil Nadu Water and Drainage Board, 2006 (5) CTC 178 it is held as under: 
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“9. The <span style="text-decoration:underline">report</span> of the advocate commissioner <span style="text-decoration:underline">alone can never be the basis</span> for deciding the suit as Commissioner should not be appointed to gather evidence to prove the case of the parties. Parties should <span style="text-decoration:underline">prove their case by</span> themselves by letting in legally <span style="text-decoration:underline">acceptable evidence</span> and the <span style="text-decoration:underline">report </span>of the Commissioner can <span style="text-decoration:underline">only aid the court in evaluating</span> the evidence to come to a just conclusion.”</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>13. </strong>Can a Commissioner be appointed for <span style="text-decoration:underline">seizing the books of account</span> of a party to the suit in the exercise of its inherent powers?</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>No.</li>
<li>In Padam Sen v. The State of Uttar Pradesh, AIR 1961 SC 218, it was held that ‘the Munsif had no jurisdiction to appoint a Commissioner for seizing the account books of the plaintiff, which is passed by the Court is null and void’.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>14.</strong> Can <span style="text-decoration:underline">a commissioner be examined</span> (invoking Order 26) on any matter other than that “(i) touching any part of the matters referred to him or (ii) mentioned in his report, or (iii) as to his report, or (iv) as to the manner in which he has made the investigation”?</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Cannot be, under Order 26. </li>
<li>Because under O 26 r 10 (2) the Court or, with the permission of the Court, any party is not permitted to examine the Commissioner: 
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>as to a matter that is (i) not asked for and (ii) not referred to in the report.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration:underline">Note 1</span>: From O 26 r 10 (2) it comes out (the legislative intent) that examination is not permitted under Order 26 on such<span style="text-decoration:underline"> matters in the knowledge</span> of the commissioner (even if it is there) or what he had actually seen. (The principle is obvious – it should have been got reported through the commission, by the dissatisfied party, by taking steps to get it ascertained after remitting back the report, or through a fresh commission). </li>
<li><span style="text-decoration:underline">Note 2: </span>It appears that the legislative-intent in O26 r 10 canvases for a ‘perfect (or perfected) report’, rather than a report ‘stand corrected by cross examination’.</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration:underline">Note 3: </span>It is with respect to a matter ‘(i) not asked for and (ii) not referred to in the report’; and not with respect to the accuracy of the report of Commissioner, in which case it is open to the parties either to cross examine the Commissioner or lead independent evidence instead of calling fresh report in the light of objection raised (Gopala Somayaji C v. R Madhava Pai, 1988(1) Kar LJ 499).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>15. </strong>What is the <span style="text-decoration:underline">purpose of examination</span> of the commissioner in court (according to the provisions of Order 26)?</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>It is for the determination – whether the report is to be remitted back for “such further inquiry” under rule 10(3), after setting-aside the (earlier) report or otherwise. </li>
<li>This proposition is drifted from the conjoint reading of the following:
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>O26 r 10(2) 
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><sup><strong>“……. <mark class="has-inline-color has-primary-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">the Court or, with the permission of the Court, any of the parties to suit <span style="text-decoration:underline">may examine</span> the Commissioner personally in open Court touching any part of the matters <span style="text-decoration:underline">referred to him</span> or <span style="text-decoration:underline">mentioned in his report</span>, or <span style="text-decoration:underline">as to his report</span>, or as to the <span style="text-decoration:underline">manner</span> in which he has made the investigation</mark>.”</strong></sup></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>O26 r 10(3) 
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong><sup>“<mark class="has-inline-color has-primary-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Where the Court is for any reason dissatisfied with the proceedings of the Commissioner, it <span style="text-decoration:underline">may direct such further inquiry</span> to be made as it shall think fit</mark>.”</sup></strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>It appears that the legislative-intent in O26 r 10 canvases for a ‘perfect (or perfected) report’, wherever possible, rather than a report ‘stand corrected by cross examination’. Because, ‘<span style="text-decoration:underline"><mark class="has-inline-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#1200db">may direct such further inquiry</mark></span>‘ in O26 r 10(3) <mark class="has-inline-color has-primary-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">primarily mandates a </mark><mark class="has-inline-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#2200db"><span style="text-decoration:underline">further inquiry</span> </mark>by the commission itself, wherever possible. Court can appoint a commissioner suo motu, also. (Dinesh Chandra Gaur v. Abhay Sood, 2015 (2) ARC 243). </li>
<li>When a Commission report is set aside,<span style="text-decoration:underline"> the court is bound to remit it back to the Commissioner</span> for getting a fresh report. (See: Yudathadevus  v.  Joseph, 2021-5 KerHC 668; 2021- 4 KerLJ 415; 2021-6 KerLT(SN) 42. The parties should not loose their case for the lapse or mistake of the commissioner.</li>
<li>But, contra view in Gopala Somayaji C v. R Madhava Pai, 1988(1) Kar LJ 499, where it was held that to disprove the accuracy of the report of Commissioner, it is open to the parties either to cross examine the Commissioner or lead independent evidence instead of calling fresh report in the light of objection raised.</li>
<li>Note: In practice (because on practicality) the courts proceed on the commission reports ‘stand corrected by cross examination’.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>15A.</strong> <span style="text-decoration: underline">Is it mandatory to examine the commissioner before setting it aside</span></p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>The court being exercises <span style="text-decoration: underline">when it is ‘satisfied</span>‘ and it is the exercise of <strong>discretionary-jurisdiction</strong>, it is reasonable to say -it is <span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>not</strong> mandatory to examine the commissioner</span> before setting aside a commission report.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>16. </strong><span style="text-decoration:underline">Is the court ‘bound by</span>‘ Commissioner’s report?</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>No.</li>
<li>Subash Soman v. State of Kerala, 2019 -2 Ker HC 700, 2019 -2 Ker LJ 729, it is observed as under:
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“…. When a commission report and plan are filed in court, as per the direction of the court, the <span style="text-decoration:underline">court shall not act merely as a post office</span> and receive it on file. In the light of the provision contained in Order XXVI, Rule 10(3) Code, the court shall go through the report and see whether it is in order, irrespective of whether any objection is filed or not.”</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>In Retnamma v. Mehaboob, 2013 -3 Civil CC 65 (Kerala) it is held as under:
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“57. … When a commission report and plan are filed in court as per the direction of the court, the c<span style="text-decoration:underline">ourt shall not act merely as a post office and receive it on file</span>. It is the bounden duty of the court to go through the commission report and <span style="text-decoration:underline">consider whether </span>the commission report is satisfactory or not and whether it <span style="text-decoration:underline">contains all the relevant details as may be necessary to resolve the dispute.</span> It shall see whether the report is defective or unsatisfactory for any reason or whether any clarification is required in the report.</li>
<li>58. In short, the court shall confirm that commissioner has elucidated all relevant facts which will help the court to take a right decision in the case. In the light of the provision contained in Order 26 Rule 10 (3) C.P.C., <span style="text-decoration:underline">the court shall go through the report and see whether it is in Order</span>, irrespective of whether any objection is filed or not. Order 26 Rule 10(3) C.P.C. lays down that <span style="text-decoration:underline">where the Court is dissatisfied with the proceedings</span> of the Commissioner, for any reason, it may <span style="text-decoration:underline">direct the commissioner to make such further inquiry</span> as it thinks fit.”</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>In Amena Bibi Versus Sk. Abdul Haque, AIR 1997 Cal. 59, Calcutta High Court held that the Commissioner’s report even if accepted by itself <span style="text-decoration:underline">does not however, mean that the parties are precluded</span> from challenging the evidence of the Commissioner or assailing the report<span style="text-decoration:underline"> by examining any other witness </span>to counter the effect of the report.</li>
<li>The report submitted by the Commissioner is only <span style="text-decoration:underline">a piece of evidence</span> (Harihar Misra v. Narhari Setti Sitaramiah, AIR 1966 Ori 121; New Meena Sahkari Awas Samiti Ltd. v. Addl. District Judge, 2016 (6) AWC 5988) which <span style="text-decoration:underline">has to be considered along with other evidence on record</span>. (Tulamaya Chettri v. Yonarayan Pradhan, AIR 2004 Sik 39; Mahendranat Parida v. Purnananda Parida, AIR 1988 Ori 248)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>17. <span style="text-decoration: underline">Should First CR be <strong>Set Aside</strong> to Issue a Second Commission?</span></strong></p>
<p>There is difference of opinion.</p>
<p>One view is that the Court Cannot (even) Set Aside a Commission Report, which “<mark class="has-inline-color has-primary-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><span style="text-decoration: underline">shall form part of the record</span></mark>” by virtue of O26 r. 10(2) CPC. There is no provision in the CPC to set aside a Commission Report.</p>
<p>O26 r. 10(3) CPC makes it clear:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Where the Court is for any reason dissatisfied with the proceedings of the Commissioner, it may direct such further inquiry to be made as it shall think fit.</li>
</ul>
<p>O26 r. 10(3) does <strong>not</strong> specifically say –</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>(1) the court has the authority to <strong>set aside</strong> a commission report (See: Francis Assissi v. Sr. Breesiya, 2017 (1) KLT 1041);</li>
<li>(2) if the court is dissatisfied with the commission report,  it shall <strong>set aside </strong>the commission report; or</li>
<li>(3) for issuing a second/fresh commission the first commissioner’s report should have been <strong>set aside</strong>. </li>
</ul>
<p>Following arguments can also be placed in support of the view that a commission report cannot be set aside:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Commissioner’s report  is only a piece of evidence (Paul K Lalthakima v. District Collector, Aizawl, 2018-4 GauLT 854; Sarojini v. Karthiyani Amma,  ILR  2010-1Ker 17, 2010-1 KHC 193; Geetarani Panda v. Manmath Patra, 2009-108 Cut LT 355).</li>
<li>There can be any number of such reports.<strong><sup><mark class="has-inline-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#1904e4">#*</mark></sup></strong> If two Commission Reports differ on a point, the court can evaluate and assess the same with other evidence and can come to a correct conclusion. 
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong><sup><mark class="has-inline-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#1904e4">#*</mark></sup></strong><sup><strong>(No doubt, <strong>they cannot be allowed to overfill</strong> the court; the restrictive mechanism is provided by the words in O26 r. 10(3) – that is,  a second commission can be ordered  if only  “<mark class="has-inline-color has-primary-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">the court is, for any reason, <span style="text-decoration: underline">dissatisfied</span> with the proceedings of the Commissioner</mark></strong></sup><strong><sup><strong>” and there is <span style="text-decoration: underline">need for a further enquir</span>y.</strong></sup></strong><sup><strong>)</strong> </sup></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>It is laid down in O 26 r. 10(2) CPC that the commission report shall be evidence in the suit and shall form part of the record (See: Francis Assissi v. Sr. Breesiya, 2017 (1) KLT 1041).  O 26 r. 10(2) reads-
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“<mark class="has-inline-color has-primary-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">The report of the Commissioner and the evidence taken by him (but not the evidence without the report) <span style="text-decoration: underline">shall be evidence in the suit and shall form part of the record</span></mark>.”</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Further, O26 r. 14(2), which stands for commission-to-make-partition, engrafts – “<mark class="has-inline-color has-primary-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">after hearing any objections which the parties may make to the report or reports, (court) shall confirm, vary or <span style="text-decoration: underline">set aside the same</span></mark>“. But, such a power is conspicuously avoided in O26 r. 10 CPC (See: Francis Assissi v. Sr. Breesiya, 2017 (1) KLT 1041)</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline">Other View – Court has to Set Aside the 1<sup>st</sup> Report for issuing a 2<sup>nd</sup> Commission</span></p>
<p>A bunch of decisions authoritatively lay down that the first commissioner’s report must have been <strong>set aside</strong> for appointing another commissioner.</p>
<p>The courts brought forth, for that matter-</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Inherent power under Sec. 151 CPC (See: Chinmaya Saha v. Renuka Halder, AIR 2016 Cal 33) and</li>

<li>It is also pointed out that <span style="text-decoration: underline">O26 r. 10(3) CPC</span> is attracted (for directing further inquiry, without setting aside first CR) only when there are some <span style="text-decoration: underline">deficiencies or omissions</span> in the Report of the Commissioner.</li>
</ul>
<p>Analysing O26 r. 10(3) CPC it is observed in <strong>Swami Premananda Bharathi v. Swami Yogananda Bharathi, AIR 1985 Ker 83</strong>, as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“The <span style="text-decoration: underline">first commissioner’s report and proceedings should be <strong>set aside</strong></span> for reasons to be recorded and t<span style="text-decoration: underline">hen only the court can proceed to appoint another commissioner</span> to do the work is a wholesome rule of law based on public policy….  the appointment of the second Commissioner and the reports filed by him without setting aside the first Commissioner’s report is wholly illegal and without jurisdiction.”</li>
</ul>
<p>In Yudathadevus  v.  Joseph, 2021-5 KerHC 668; 2021- 4 KerLJ 415; 2021-6 KerLT(SN) 42, following Swami Premananda Bharathi v. Swami Yogananda Bharathi (and discarding Francis Assissi v. Sr. Breesiya, 2017-1 Ker LT 1041), it is observed as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“If a court is dissatisfied with the proceedings of the commissioner, the <span style="text-decoration: underline">court can direct further inquiry</span> to be made as it shall think fit <span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>after setting aside </strong>the commission report</span> and plan to get the mistakes or the defects rectified.”</li>

</ul>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">Apparent Legal Position on the First-Principles</span></strong></p>
<p>As pointed out in Francis Assissi v. Sr. Breesiya, 2017 (1) KLT 1041, O26 r. 10(3) does <span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>not</strong> specifically say</span> that the c<span style="text-decoration: underline">ourt has the authority to <strong>set aside</strong> a commission report</span>, which automatically forms part of the record. </p>
<p>A commission report  is only a piece of evidence. Therefore, it is definite, on the first-principles, that there is no bar to issue a second commission in a proper case, <span style="text-decoration: underline">without setting aside</span> the earlier commission report; but, it <span style="text-decoration: underline">can be done only after</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline">recording a definite finding that</span> – </p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>that the <span style="text-decoration: underline">earlier Commission Report is not satisfactory</span> and </li>
<li>that there is <span style="text-decoration: underline">need for a further enquir</span>y’ </li>
</ul>
<p>as observed in R. Viswanathan v. P. Shanmugham, 1985-1 MLJ 254. It reads as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“It is well settled proposition that until the Court is dissatisfied with the proceedings and report of the Commissioner earlier appointed, <span style="text-decoration: underline">it will not be proper to ignore the same and direct even further enquiry</span>, much less the scrapping of the earlier report as a whole and appoint a fresh Commissioner.

<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">Effect of Two Commission Reports in File</span></strong></p>
<p>Assume, rightly or wrongly, two commission reports were brought to file; then, should the first report be discarded totally?</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Since (i) the commission reports are pieces of evidence, (ii) it forms part of evidence and (iii) no express legal provision permits to discard such a report, it may not be proper to totally discard the first report.</li>

<li>In Retnamma v.

However this decision considered – <span style="text-decoration:underline">can a plan prepared by a Surveyor b</span>e <span style="text-decoration:underline">treated as ‘evidence’, ipso facto.</span>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>It is <span style="text-decoration:underline">answered ‘no’ </span>holding that if the <span style="text-decoration:underline">commissioner did not state </span>anything in his report about<span style="text-decoration:underline"> Surveyor’s plan to vouchsafe correctness</span> of the details of measurement shown in the plan etc., details shown in surveyor’s plan cannot be relied upon by the court. </li>
</ul>

</ul>
<p>The Kerala High Court, in Retnamma v. Mehaboob, observed as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>(i) Order 26 Rule 10 (2) CPC speaks on <span style="text-decoration:underline">‘Evidence’ (without the report</span>).</li>
<li>(ii) What is intended to be treated as <span style="text-decoration:underline">‘evidence’</span> are the facts, which the commissioner has reported in his report about which, <span style="text-decoration:underline">commissioner has direct knowledge.</span></li>
<li>(iii) The provision contained in Order 26 Rule 10 (2) CPC is not intended to admit ‘hearsay evidence’. (<span style="text-decoration:underline">Hearsay is no evidence</span> – Section 60 of Evidence Act.)</li>
<li>(iv) However, if commissioner reports the correctness of the <span style="text-decoration:underline">plan</span>, on the basis of what he had <span style="text-decoration:underline">personally observed</span>, the <span style="text-decoration:underline">commissioner is</span> <span style="text-decoration:underline">competent to give </span>‘<span style="text-decoration:underline">evidence</span>‘, by virtue of Order 26 Rule 10 (2) CPC.</li>
<li>(v) <span style="text-decoration:underline">Mere marking</span> of a document will <span style="text-decoration:underline">not tantamount to proof</span> of its execution nor will it prove correctness of the facts stated in the writing contained in the document.

<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><span style="text-decoration:underline">Note:</span> When the survey-plan prepared by a survey-commission is not challenged,  it appears that in the f<span style="text-decoration:underline">act situation of a particular case</span>, it may go in evidence (in spite of its infirmities – including the hearsay rule), on the principles of <span style="text-decoration:underline">estoppel and presumption</span>.

<p><strong><u>Discrepancy between Pleading and Commission Report</u></strong>; Should plaint be Amended?</p>
<p>In Muttil Rajan v. Kuthirakkal Letha, Kerala High Court (Thomas P. Joseph, J.), 2012, found that the plaint schedule extent (lesser in measurement) has to be accepted. It is held as under:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“24. It is pointed out by the learned counsel for the appellants that in Exts. C1 and C2, the measurement given for the plaint C schedule is a length of 3 meters and width of 1.10 meters. But in the plaint C schedule, the measurement  given is length of 2.5 meters and width of 3 feet. The learned counsel for the respondents points out that the discrepancy arose in Exts. C1 and C2 only because the Advocate Commissioner has measured the length of the way from the tar end of the public road on the extreme north.</li>
<li>25. I must also notice that in Exts.C1 and C2, whatever be the length stated, the Advocate Commissioner has shown that the plaint C schedule starts from the public road on the northern side, goes along the eastern portion of the plaint B schedule and reaches the plaint A schedule. In other words the plaint C schedule as shown by the Advocate Commissioner in Exts.C1 and C2 whatever be its length, has its starting point at the north eastern corner of the plaint A schedule and termini at the public road on the northern side of the plaint B schedule. I must also notice that the decree granted by the trial court and confirmed by the first appellate court is with respect to the plaint C schedule.”</li>
